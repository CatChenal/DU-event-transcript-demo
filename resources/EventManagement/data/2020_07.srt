met Shelby back in August in San

40
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,369
Francisco when I was there for the right

41
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:56,430
speak code conference Shelby is the head

42
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:58,110
of analytics at Komodo health and as an

43
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,850
analyst professional and former software

44
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:01,740
engineer Shelby has been involved in

45
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:04,140
shaping great products or companies big

46
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,530
and small for the last 13 plus years

47
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:09,330
she's worked on various analyses

48
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:11,970
previously she worked at Salesforce and

49
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,870
she I guess the really impressive thing

50
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,090
here

51
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:17,490
additionally is that she has worked with

52
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:30,300
a really large data a data at scale um

53
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:31,620
40 million plus users and then I think

54
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:37,110

again Reshma for the introduction and

63
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:12,540
today I am going to walk you all through

64
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:15,000
how I think that Sherlock Holmes would

65
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:17,010
have fixed back data and I hope you're

66
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,880
all as excited about investigating data

67
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:23,940
anomalies as I am so just to pick a

68
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:26,910
little bit about me so this is me as a

69
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:29,820
child I used to spend a lot of time

70
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:31,620
reading detective novels and after I had

71
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:34,650
finished reading one I used to go around

72
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:36,959
hunting in my backyard for cues I have

73
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:39,360
no idea what I was what mystery I was

74
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,610
trying to solve but one day I found this

75
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,620
big huge lemon as you can see it's

76
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:45,360
almost the size of my face

77
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:48,180
and I didn't even know we had a lemon

78
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,890
tree so for my five-year-old for my 11

79
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,900
year old self this was actually the most

80
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:54,810
important discovery I had ever made at

81
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,400
that point and it just convinced me that

82
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:59,700
I'm gonna go on to do very exciting

83
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,470
things in my future and I don't think I

84
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,570
ended up doing some exciting things I

85
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:06,720
worked with a lot of different companies

86
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:08,760
of different sizes mostly in analytics

87
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,340
which I've been involved in for almost a

88
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:14,850
decade but even though I started as an

89
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:17,609
engineer and now I am the head of

90
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:22,590
analytics at Komodo health where I lead

91
00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:25,410
a team of eight data scientists so today

92
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:25,950
we're gonna talk about three things one

93
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:28,710
what is

94
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:34,580
bad data and why should you care about

95
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:39,240
it and how do we actually fix it so

96
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:41,310
sorry bad data is essentially my

97
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,000
definition is that it's inaccurate

98
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:46,260
incomplete or misleading data and

99
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,530
essentially what that encompasses is

100
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:52,050
anything that's wrong anytime there is

101
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:53,850
missing information or there's duplicate

102
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:56,430
information but it's not actually tagged

103
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:58,050
as such or there's some information or

104
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:00,810
data that's low quality that's

105
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:02,610
incorrectly transformed that can imply

106
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:04,800
something different than what what it

107
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:07,890
really means all of that comes under the

108
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,750
umbrella of bad data now this is

109
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:11,790
obviously just my definition I'm sure

110
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:15,120
what you really want is a scientific

111
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:18,090
definition and this is this is the best

112
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,140
that I came up with bad data is anything

113
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:21,810
that makes you want to throw your

114
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:26,370
computer across the room because it just

115
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:29,400
makes everything terrible so I would

116
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:32,070
like to call out that what bad data is

117
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:34,170
it is just if it's not something that

118
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:36,360
you want to see or if it's not something

119
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:39,030
that you feel good about like that

120
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,860
doesn't make it bad data it's it still

121
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:41,760
has to fit the requirement of it being

122
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,640
inaccurate

123
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:46,440
in some way and just because you don't

124
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:50,100
like what it tells you it doesn't make

125
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:52,170
it bad so with that distinction

126
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:55,920
you know let's actually walk through a

127
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:59,460
couple of quick examples of how I think

128
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:01,290
bad data actually manifests so one of

129
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:04,590
the most common things that I have seen

130
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:06,720
is that you know you're trying to pull

131
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:09,270
up revenue numbers because revenue is

132
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,160
important and you have a sales force

133
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:13,530
table that says you made 32 million

134
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,720
dollars last year and you have an

135
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:18,210
internal table that says you made 35

136
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,210
million dollars so automatically the

137
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:22,530
question is well which one is right and

138
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:24,570
you know that three million dollar gap

139
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:27,180
that is going to decide whether your

140
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:29,280
company invests in more snacks for your

141
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,550
kitchen for example so it's a really

142
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,590
important thing to sort of solve for and

143
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:36,120
you want to make sure that you trust the

144
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:37,440
data that you have and if you don't

145
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,630
trust it like you have some caveats

146
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,460
attached to it and things like that

147
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:46,030
the other really common thing that shows

148
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:48,400
up is just you know something where the

149
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:50,980
analysis just looks really suspicious so

150
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,890
in the in you know in this new chart you

151
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:56,320
can see that you it shows you revenue by

152
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:58,150
country and it shows you you have twenty

153
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:01,210
five million dollars that you made in UK

154
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:03,130
and then you note that you're actually a

155
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:04,720
company that's located in North America

156
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:06,850
you haven't even ever marketed in Europe

157
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,520
see all the North American countries

158
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:11,530
make sense so you know who are all these

159
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,240
people in UK who are buying your product

160
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:15,910
it just doesn't make sense that it would

161
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:18,370
be the biggest country where you'd have

162
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:20,830
revenue from so things like this they

163
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:22,600
basically you know are a starting point

164
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:26,080
where you start wondering what's going

165
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:27,580
on and you know what is this bad data or

166
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,280
like where is all this information

167
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:35,410
coming from and the next logical

168
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:37,210
question that comes up is you know where

169
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:40,930
where is this bad data getting created

170
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:43,660
created in the first place so for me

171
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:45,940
like the way I think about it there is

172
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:49,390
essentially a life cycle of data that

173
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:52,300
has many phases and each of those phases

174
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:54,580
has some inherent risks that are

175
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:56,919
associated with it where bad data can be

176
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:58,780
introduced so I know there's a lot of

177
00:07:56,919 --> 00:08:00,880
information on this slide and I'm going

178
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:02,890
to try to break it down I put it as one

179
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:06,250
visual because I actually personally

180
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:08,050
have this printed out on my desk because

181
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:10,450
I like to refer to it just to sort of

182
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:11,860
fact check you know any investigation

183
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:13,120
that I'm struggling with I try to make

184
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:16,360
sure I'm covering my bases

185
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:19,030
so say let me let me walk you through

186
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:21,190
what's actually in here so on the on the

187
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:25,090
left you see the the five different

188
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:27,010
phases of introducing bad data so the

189
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:30,900
first one that we start off is is just

190
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:33,660
the definition this is where you know

191
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:36,250
the data team and the product team are

192
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:38,289
reconciling and they're saying what are

193
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:41,680
the features that we even want to

194
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:43,630
consider as one coherent unit and then

195
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,300
what data requirements do we sort of

196
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:48,880
associated with it

197
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:51,100
after that you go on to login where you

198
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,570
actually translate some of those

199
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,280
definitions that

200
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:57,430
you had created in the previous step and

201
00:08:54,280 --> 00:09:01,930
turn them into actual code that you can

202
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:04,240
use to log and store that data after

203
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:06,880
that you are transforming that data in

204
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,440
some way and what you're essentially

205
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,620
looking at is you're looking at your

206
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:15,220
business rules and you're applying those

207
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:16,990
rules to do that tracked data so that

208
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:18,640
you can convert it into a format that

209
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:22,690
actually makes sense that is actually

210
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:25,450
usable after that comes the fun part

211
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:27,400
you're actually analyzing it so data

212
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:29,260
scientists typically they have to

213
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,240
interpret the data based on you know

214
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:34,210
actual business questions that they're

215
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:36,550
trying to solve for and that is that is

216
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:39,520
where a lot of the action happens

217
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:42,790
and finally after this you actually

218
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:44,500
share out your results and it can happen

219
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:46,690
in a bunch of different ways it can

220
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:49,840
happen in the way of an ad hoc analysis

221
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:52,090
or some some self-service reports things

222
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:55,020
like that and all of these these things

223
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:58,210
are shared directly with stakeholders so

224
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:59,830
during all of these phases I've you know

225
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:02,830
on the on the right I've kind of

226
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:04,960
highlighted a few common things that I

227
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:06,640
observe in each of the phases like which

228
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:09,790
are just according to me they're the

229
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,990
most they're the most logical places

230
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:13,030
where something goes wrong

231
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:15,610
so I actually look at all of these

232
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:17,110
things just as a as a sanity check when

233
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:18,880
I'm trying to investigate what happened

234
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:21,130
I'm going to walk you through a couple

235
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,050
of them I won't walk you through all but

236
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:25,920
because some of them I'll be discussing

237
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:28,300
later when I'm talking about fixes so

238
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,910
you know some of the most obvious ones

239
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:35,890
all most common ones that I see is

240
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:37,300
actually in the definition stage so you

241
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:39,700
know when we when we think about

242
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:42,130
features anything that we are trying to

243
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:44,770
track it has some sort of a definition

244
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:47,230
associated with it and how we define

245
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:49,330
that feature can make a lot of

246
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:52,630
difference in to what insights they're

247
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:56,200
able to get from it at a later stage so

248
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:58,960
if you don't evenly apply the same you

249
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:01,090
know same sort of intention behind some

250
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:03,610
of these feature definitions it can get

251
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:06,570
quite confusing later on so an example

252
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:06,570
here is that let's say you

253
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:12,640
you know your product team says I want

254
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:15,070
to track all clicks on this page any

255
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,730
click that happens I want to check it so

256
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:17,970
that's so pretty

257
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:22,540
like it's a pretty all-encompassing

258
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:24,520
definition but you also have you know as

259
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:27,310
a team that's dedicated to tracking

260
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:29,080
things that occur on mobile and so in

261
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:31,000
mobile environment they'll be like yeah

262
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,950
I want to track the chicks there too so

263
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,640
initially you logically think that all

264
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:39,040
my all my clicks on the on the website

265
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,780
are being tracked and some some subset

266
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:45,130
of them would have happened on the

267
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:48,010
mobile but if mobile team decides to not

268
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:49,360
track all the clicks and only like three

269
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:52,150
of the buttons that you can possibly

270
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:55,090
click then you have definitions that are

271
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:58,270
not evenly aligned because you'd assume

272
00:11:55,090 --> 00:12:00,700
that you know the the website clicks are

273
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:03,880
still kind of the superset of everything

274
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:06,880
but you'd expect that the mobile subset

275
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:09,700
is a full subset for all mobile clicks

276
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:12,280
but it's actually only tracking three

277
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:16,540
three types of clicks so that can cause

278
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:18,520
issues because anybody who's done this

279
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:20,380
long enough knows that they'll always be

280
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:22,360
that one person who'll say I want that

281
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:24,370
one click on mobile that nobody's

282
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,600
tracking like give me information on

283
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,830
that like you know you're giving me

284
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,290
information about everything else what

285
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:31,900
about that one so the more thoughtful

286
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:33,670
you are upfront about like making sure

287
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:35,440
you're tracking everything evenly it'll

288
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:40,330
it'll just be easier in the in the long

289
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:43,150
run the other example is at the analysis

290
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:44,650
phase so you know I think that's again

291
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:47,650
one of the most common things that

292
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:50,950
happen that you just don't define the

293
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:54,580
problem it's it's very ambiguous because

294
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:57,670
especially when we're you know one human

295
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:59,590
talking to another human you know you're

296
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:01,180
two separate humans so you're always

297
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:02,650
gonna have some things that you're not

298
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:06,100
where you're not aligned where you don't

299
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:07,930
understand each other and you know if

300
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,700
you're talking to a product manager they

301
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:11,410
can make certain assumptions that like

302
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:14,110
oh I'm sure they already know this and

303
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:15,970
then you can make certain assumptions

304
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:18,910
like oh I already like of course they

305
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:20,870
know that this can't happen so if you

306
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:23,900
don't actually clarify some of those

307
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:27,460
that can result in some very tough

308
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:30,140
consequences you know you may end up

309
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:32,540
spending a lot of time doing some work

310
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:34,070
which has to be redone because there was

311
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:36,200
an incorrect assumption in the first

312
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:38,120
place or worse

313
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,220
maybe the error never gets discovered

314
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,600
because you are all you're both calling

315
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,560
in the same thing but you're actually

316
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:47,510
doing something that's completely

317
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:49,520
different so these type of examples you

318
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:51,320
know you can you can kind of look

319
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:53,180
through the remaining ones later but

320
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:57,850
these are some common things that kind

321
00:13:53,180 --> 00:14:00,740
of show up all right so why should

322
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:02,720
organizations or you know anybody even

323
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:06,220
care about all this bad data now that

324
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:10,100
we've seen a couple of ways it showed up

325
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:12,400
so I think inherently the big takeaway

326
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:16,190
that I have seen over the years is that

327
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:18,800
bad data is just costly it's costly at

328
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:21,950
every single level across the company I

329
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:24,020
think you know to start with the people

330
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:26,750
who are working who have to deal with it

331
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:29,360
it is it hampers their productivity

332
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:31,220
if you don't upfront spend that time and

333
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,920
effort in trying to keep things clean

334
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:36,110
and it affects our morale because they

335
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,910
feel that you know this is this is just

336
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:40,940
I spend so much time doing something I

337
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:43,040
don't want to do it can also affect it

338
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:45,020
can cause liabilities you can sometimes

339
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,750
end up sharing information that you had

340
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:49,730
you're not supposed to or you shared

341
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:53,090
incorrect information that's specially a

342
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:55,490
problem if if you're a public traded

343
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:58,010
publicly traded company and you had an

344
00:14:55,490 --> 00:15:01,010
earnings call where you said I have you

345
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:03,560
know X number of monthly active users

346
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:05,660
and then the next earnings call you're

347
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:08,480
like well just kidding it's actually 20%

348
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:10,190
lower because I made a mistake that's

349
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,740
not gonna look good and you might your

350
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:16,520
company might actually get sued for for

351
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:19,460
misleading shareholders so bias of

352
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:21,650
course is a big problem you know if you

353
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:23,900
if you have some if you have some data

354
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:26,300
that's inherently biased and that's not

355
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:28,730
known to you like that's just it's it's

356
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:31,130
it's a it's it's a it's a issue because

357
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:33,470
it can cause harm to people based on

358
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:34,339
whatever decisions are being made with

359
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:37,670
that data

360
00:15:34,339 --> 00:15:40,129
and overall you know you can also just

361
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:42,110
straight-up lose revenue so if you have

362
00:15:40,129 --> 00:15:44,509
a bad data pipeline and data goes

363
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:46,819
missing maybe your marketing team

364
00:15:44,509 --> 00:15:48,949
doesn't have leads to follow up on and

365
00:15:46,819 --> 00:15:52,550
that can lead to material revenue

366
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:55,249
revenue costs overall I think the

367
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:57,439
biggest the biggest reason that I think

368
00:15:55,249 --> 00:16:00,860
this is important is also because it

369
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:02,899
lowers trust the minute your customers

370
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:05,660
find out that there is something sketchy

371
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:08,180
going on with your data that can often

372
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:09,649
be just game over for you because if

373
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:15,139
they do if they don't trust your data

374
00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:17,480
they don't it had a really trust you the

375
00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:19,249
one thing that I again like to sort of

376
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:21,620
highlight a little bit more is that I

377
00:16:19,249 --> 00:16:23,660
think you know besides all those other

378
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:26,420
reasons which have a cost attached to it

379
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:28,879
I think just the fact that data

380
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:31,249
scientists have no moral because it's

381
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:33,769
something like this is reason enough for

382
00:16:31,249 --> 00:16:36,889
people to care about it you know data

383
00:16:33,769 --> 00:16:38,779
scientists have to find the error find

384
00:16:36,889 --> 00:16:40,929
the source validate cross checking it so

385
00:16:38,779 --> 00:16:44,089
it's a lot of work that goes into

386
00:16:40,929 --> 00:16:46,939
resolving some of these issues and I

387
00:16:44,089 --> 00:16:48,949
think inherently it very much is a part

388
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:50,959
of a data scientist job to do this but

389
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:53,120
inherently they feel well my skills are

390
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:56,319
so much you know there's so much other

391
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:59,269
cool stuff that I can be doing and so

392
00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:01,309
everyone wants to be they everyone wants

393
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:03,470
their talents to be used in an optimal

394
00:17:01,309 --> 00:17:05,750
way and you don't want people leaving

395
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:09,789
leaving a job just because they're

396
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:15,409
always dealing with dirty data issues so

397
00:17:09,789 --> 00:17:20,480
good so next you know how do we actually

398
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:22,309
solve it my my thought here is I think I

399
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,640
think we solve it by thinking like

400
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:28,159
Sherlock Holmes and for for those of you

401
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:30,500
who are not familiar with him Sherlock

402
00:17:28,159 --> 00:17:33,620
Holmes is a fictitious character created

403
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:35,390
by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle he is arguably

404
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:37,730
one of the most famous fictional

405
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:40,100
detectives and there's a lot of books

406
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:42,320
and movies about like that character so

407
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:45,740
check it out if you haven't had the

408
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:47,600
chance to so why did I actually pick

409
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:50,480
Sherlock Holmes

410
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:54,559
for you know why did I pick that we

411
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:57,260
should emulate his his style so I

412
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:59,630
actually think that his style of solving

413
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:01,760
crimes is very relevant to data

414
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:04,460
scientists even though hopefully we're

415
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,919
not solving crimes just data issues but

416
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:09,919
I think inherently we're doing

417
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:12,950
investigations and I think a lot of his

418
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:15,200
personality traits are very good if you

419
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:17,510
think of a philosophy of how data

420
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,630
scientist should think I think it's very

421
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:22,880
it's it's it's a it's very relevant and

422
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:24,530
inherently Sherlock Holmes is always

423
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,110
presented as a very very data-driven

424
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:30,500
character so I think his methodologies

425
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:33,049
are actually extremely relevant and the

426
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:36,080
three sort of traits of his that I

427
00:18:33,049 --> 00:18:39,590
picked which are sort of you know larger

428
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:42,770
bucketing of of some of his personality

429
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:47,210
are deep observation scientific method

430
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:49,340
and pattern matching so let's dive into

431
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:55,640
a little bit of each of these and see

432
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:58,070
how they sort of manifest so his deep

433
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:00,169
observation is so there's a very famous

434
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:04,309
quote that Sherlock Holmes says in one

435
00:19:00,169 --> 00:19:07,760
of the books he says he says you see but

436
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:10,340
you do not observe and that's a that's a

437
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:13,809
that's a very interesting difference

438
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:16,309
distinction to call out that if

439
00:19:13,809 --> 00:19:19,940
essentially when we have data in front

440
00:19:16,309 --> 00:19:22,730
of us our default is to look at it and

441
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:25,520
absorb the information ances but when we

442
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:28,850
actually start observing it more closely

443
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:31,610
we gain more nuance by just interacting

444
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:34,370
with that information as an active

445
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:37,760
participant and that is a skill that I

446
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:39,260
think is worth building on so some of

447
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:43,280
the ways that you can build on that

448
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:47,809
skill is to just be fully present and

449
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:49,909
very mindful so when you're mindfully

450
00:19:47,809 --> 00:19:52,220
interacting with not just the person who

451
00:19:49,909 --> 00:19:53,690
you know your stakeholder your your

452
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:55,190
business partner like people like that

453
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:57,710
like when you're mindfully interacting

454
00:19:55,190 --> 00:20:00,409
with them you're more engaged you are

455
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:01,120
not going to be distracted and that will

456
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:03,340
mean that

457
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:07,180
don't you don't miss out on something

458
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:09,430
that's critical for you to you know be

459
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:10,870
able to solve the problem at hand and I

460
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:14,500
think it's one of the best ways to have

461
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:16,390
impact the other way to improve your

462
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:18,490
observation is to be an active

463
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:23,020
participant in with whatever you're

464
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:24,520
doing so you know one of the you know

465
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:27,160
one of the fun examples that they called

466
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:29,200
out is that you know when Sherlock

467
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:31,300
Holmes was given you know he said they

468
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,400
said oh here we found this note and this

469
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:34,120
is a clue so he didn't actually just

470
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,610
read it

471
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:39,040
he didn't just like you know look at it

472
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:40,780
he he actually smelt it too because he

473
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:43,390
said you know smelling it is gonna give

474
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:46,090
me some extra insight and I just reading

475
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:48,429
it doesn't doesn't gave me and that is a

476
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:51,070
very interesting thing because you're

477
00:20:48,429 --> 00:20:52,630
you know you're actively participating

478
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:54,309
with the information in front of you

479
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:56,440
you're you're being inclusive you're not

480
00:20:54,309 --> 00:20:58,780
just saying well this is how I normally

481
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,850
look at data but like you're trying to

482
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:02,980
be you're trying to be thoughtful and

483
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:06,130
getting into the weeds of how you can

484
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:11,200
use use information in in in to tell you

485
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:13,420
different insights the next thing again

486
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,809
about improving your observation is to

487
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:20,620
structure your thinking so this one is

488
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:22,540
you know I think like all good engineers

489
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:24,100
have to do it you have to just be

490
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:26,140
structured you have to keep good

491
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:27,610
documentation I think for data

492
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:30,670
scientists it's especially relevant

493
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:32,740
because you know sometimes during our

494
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:37,210
analysis we'll make some assumptions and

495
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:39,400
if it's not or we'll make some decisions

496
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:41,050
rather and if it's not an intuitive

497
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,650
decision like why did we make that

498
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,750
decision

499
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:46,840
maybe we made it because we spoke to a

500
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:48,730
colleague who pointed something out and

501
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:50,980
if two months later we'd forget why we

502
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:53,679
why we decided to go this direction with

503
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:55,420
our analysis it will be really helpful

504
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,940
to you if you have actually sort of

505
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:59,410
documented that somewhere so that even

506
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:01,330
you yourself are not struggling with

507
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:06,190
figuring out why you why you did

508
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:07,750
something specific so you know and and

509
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:10,720
like being structured also means that

510
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:13,179
you you try to look at information and

511
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,860
sift through it and say like you know

512
00:22:13,179 --> 00:22:16,690
let me step back and

513
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:18,370
what is actually useful to me what is

514
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:20,200
just a red herring or something that's

515
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:24,850
kind of taking me away from what I'm

516
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:27,390
actually trying to do here the next

517
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:32,920
character trait was scientific method

518
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:34,570
and here again you know the famous quote

519
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:36,730
here is when you have eliminated the

520
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:39,940
impossible whatever remains however

521
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:42,160
improbable must be the truth it's a very

522
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:45,250
it's a very scientific way of thinking

523
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:47,530
about it cuz we you know we have to

524
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:50,200
regard facts as truth even if we can't

525
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:52,870
see it and if the most likely answer is

526
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,890
not the answer and the impossible answer

527
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:57,730
is not the answer

528
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:59,710
we have to give the improbable answer a

529
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:02,049
chance to prove itself and we have to be

530
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:03,940
truthful saying that if this is where

531
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:04,570
things are pointing me I have to give it

532
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:06,760
a shot

533
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:10,929
to sort of see if that's actually true

534
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:13,330
or not so here again you know you can

535
00:23:10,929 --> 00:23:16,690
build on this scale by just generally

536
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:19,660
avoided avoiding the trap of bias and I

537
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:21,640
think you know a lot of times it's it's

538
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:25,929
very easy like it's human nature that we

539
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:27,700
are the if we're given if you're given

540
00:23:25,929 --> 00:23:29,950
something that makes our life easier so

541
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:32,950
someone States an opinion which sounds

542
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:36,429
kind of correct like it makes our brain

543
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:39,669
is programmed to just attach to it

544
00:23:36,429 --> 00:23:40,780
because it makes our life easier so but

545
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:42,540
we should we should you know

546
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:46,360
purposefully step away from that because

547
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:49,210
a lot of times opinions are stated as

548
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:50,980
facts and people then there must have

549
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:53,230
been tons of companies that you know

550
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:54,610
said hey our monthly active users just

551
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:57,940
never go down like we're a growing

552
00:23:54,610 --> 00:24:00,250
company and then coronavirus hit and of

553
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:03,370
course a lot of companies lost lost

554
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:05,020
users and if they had treated that as a

555
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:07,450
fact that like there's just no way that

556
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:09,760
we can ever have less people coming to

557
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:12,880
our site you know they would have just

558
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:15,010
found it way harder to be like well you

559
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,260
know why is this happening now of course

560
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:18,760
in this example I'm assuming people

561
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:20,650
weren't living under a rock and they

562
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:22,419
kind of heard about the covert situation

563
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:24,280
so hopefully they would have been able

564
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:25,929
to piece things together but you know

565
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:28,660
there could be some situations there you

566
00:24:25,929 --> 00:24:30,580
just don't know what's going on

567
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:33,850
and the other thing sharer is you know

568
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:35,860
we tend to the information that is

569
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:38,740
available to us like the information

570
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:40,660
that's in front of us that we can see we

571
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:43,390
tend to weigh that more heavily than

572
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:46,780
what we don't have access to so for

573
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:50,170
example if I have access to the signups

574
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:53,560
that occurred on my website but I don't

575
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:55,840
have access to the actual you know

576
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:58,510
volume of people who came to my site and

577
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:01,240
bounced out without signing up I will

578
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:02,830
just look at my signups and be like yeah

579
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,450
it's going really well

580
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:07,210
you know I'm I have so many people

581
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:10,690
coming to my site but the fact is while

582
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:13,600
that singularly might be true if you

583
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:16,480
just have had a lot more people come and

584
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:18,640
yes overall your signups are going going

585
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:21,640
higher but your rate of conversion is

586
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,470
actually lowering your you're missing

587
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,940
out on key information by like just

588
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:28,890
being biased towards the information

589
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,890
that's available to you at that point

590
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:35,320
and then you know the last way to build

591
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:37,450
this skill is to you know regular

592
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:40,570
science facts like build a hypothesis

593
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:43,120
test it out if you have multiple

594
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:45,550
multiple options to go with you rank

595
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:48,040
them pick the most likely one first to

596
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:50,410
test out and keep kind of validating

597
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:52,360
each of them until you find something

598
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:57,580
that fully explains what issues you

599
00:25:52,360 --> 00:26:01,480
might be having the last skill was about

600
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:02,920
pattern matching so you know there is

601
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:05,890
nothing more deceptive that an obvious

602
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:08,590
fact as Sherlock Holmes said and it's

603
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:09,700
it's it's because you know the

604
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:11,590
interesting thing was Holmes was

605
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:13,410
actually considered to be very good at

606
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:15,820
understanding human behavior and

607
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:17,080
predicting human behavior even though he

608
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:19,600
was considered someone who wasn't

609
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:21,760
actually very good at empathizing and I

610
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:25,060
and that may seem you know not very

611
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:28,090
aligned but the sheer fact is that when

612
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:30,520
you understand when you understand

613
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:32,220
situations people all of that better you

614
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:35,770
are much more easily able to find

615
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:38,920
patterns and you know that hey this may

616
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:41,170
present as an obvious fact but it's very

617
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:42,340
common for people to sort of you know

618
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:43,840
stated as a fact but

619
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:47,440
it's not it's not true so like let me

620
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:50,470
dig into it a little bit more so a good

621
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:52,240
way to improve on this skill is just to

622
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:55,390
be very objective when you're trying to

623
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,650
parse information you know understand

624
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:58,840
the people that you're dealing with

625
00:26:56,650 --> 00:27:00,760
understand their motivations understand

626
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,809
that fears those things could be very

627
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:05,740
different than yours

628
00:27:01,809 --> 00:27:07,210
so if you have stakeholders you know if

629
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:09,580
you have a product person and a

630
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:11,919
marketing person for both coming and

631
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:14,140
telling you this data looks wrong they

632
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:16,990
might have very different opinions on

633
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:20,500
where they think the problem occurs and

634
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:23,919
you have to still separate yourself from

635
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:25,840
you know from from sort of those two

636
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:28,179
conflicting conflicting directions and

637
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:31,240
pick what what makes the most sense for

638
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:32,830
you to investigate first because you

639
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:34,510
because you know otherwise you won't be

640
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:37,990
objective and you won't you won't stay

641
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:39,370
focused on the truth say as you hear as

642
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:41,590
you hear opinions and ideas I guess

643
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:44,200
always good to understand that also for

644
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:48,490
future reference but try to sort of like

645
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:50,140
parse the right information from it the

646
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:53,260
last way to sort of improve on that

647
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:56,409
skill is to just in general widen your

648
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:57,880
knowledge base so you know as as a data

649
00:27:56,409 --> 00:28:00,399
scientist I think it's extremely

650
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:03,760
important that like obviously we have to

651
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:06,220
get really good at understanding the

652
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:09,700
data appreciating what it does but the

653
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:12,399
other part is like if you if you do an

654
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:14,909
equally good job at also understanding

655
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:17,260
the product understanding the users

656
00:28:14,909 --> 00:28:19,029
understanding how your marketing channel

657
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:21,370
works and things like that it can

658
00:28:19,029 --> 00:28:24,010
actually allow you to make a hypothesis

659
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:26,590
much more easily when you sees things

660
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:28,090
that are going wrong and you'd be in a

661
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:30,370
better position because you would have

662
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:32,289
seen some odd things that happen which

663
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:34,750
if you just focused on the data you

664
00:28:32,289 --> 00:28:37,240
wouldn't have access to so it it

665
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:40,000
basically allows you to consider you

666
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:45,210
know factors outside of just just what's

667
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:47,760
in what's in front of you all right so

668
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:49,990
hopefully they're all made sense so far

669
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:53,110
now we are actually going to walk

670
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:54,909
through an example so you know we

671
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:56,000
hopefully we understand a little bit how

672
00:28:54,909 --> 00:28:58,399
Sherlock Holmes

673
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,889
and how we can apply his mindset to our

674
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:02,000
own problem-solving techniques so now

675
00:29:00,889 --> 00:29:04,399
I'm going to walk through a simple

676
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,169
example where we will try to use some of

677
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:08,929
those philosophies that I kind of just

678
00:29:06,169 --> 00:29:12,409
highlighted and for the sake of

679
00:29:08,929 --> 00:29:15,019
simplicity I am going to go with the

680
00:29:12,409 --> 00:29:17,210
assumption that we eventually have one

681
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:18,710
warehouse where we store all our data

682
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:21,049
regardless of where it comes from

683
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:23,389
so whether it's initially coming from

684
00:29:21,049 --> 00:29:26,179
Salesforce heap website logs whatever

685
00:29:23,389 --> 00:29:28,549
all of it comes and it sits in one data

686
00:29:26,179 --> 00:29:30,889
warehouses I want to make life my life

687
00:29:28,549 --> 00:29:35,480
easier and just compare two data sets in

688
00:29:30,889 --> 00:29:37,669
the same place so this is this is

689
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:42,080
typically how they how the question

690
00:29:37,669 --> 00:29:45,159
starts and I I hope a lot of you can

691
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:47,480
relate to this specific example which is

692
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:48,950
you know you have a colleague maybe

693
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,990
they're in marketing or something and

694
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:55,700
they come to you with the question they

695
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:57,740
say the number of sales in May I pulled

696
00:29:55,700 --> 00:30:00,049
one number from Salesforce report and

697
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:02,659
today they reported something else in

698
00:30:00,049 --> 00:30:04,909
all hands and you know what's the deal

699
00:30:02,659 --> 00:30:07,070
why they why they're not matching so

700
00:30:04,909 --> 00:30:10,070
obviously a lot of things could have

701
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:11,659
gone wrong and for the purpose of this

702
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:12,860
example we are actually going to pretend

703
00:30:11,659 --> 00:30:17,210
everything that could go wrong did

704
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:20,509
indeed go wrong and yeah I like that you

705
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:22,039
know of course if you've been at a

706
00:30:20,509 --> 00:30:23,870
company for a while or if you've

707
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:26,029
interacted with that same data set for a

708
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:28,220
long time you'd probably have you'd

709
00:30:26,029 --> 00:30:31,429
probably start building out a good idea

710
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:34,820
of where the problem might be but for

711
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:36,740
this example yeah for this example I am

712
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:38,779
going to assume that you just joined two

713
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:40,909
hours ago you know no one you know

714
00:30:38,779 --> 00:30:42,919
nothing all you know is your snowflake

715
00:30:40,909 --> 00:30:46,879
warehouse password and what the

716
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:50,539
offending data sets are so before we

717
00:30:46,879 --> 00:30:54,830
begin actual coding some simple sanity

718
00:30:50,539 --> 00:30:57,070
check lists to just examine the facts we

719
00:30:54,830 --> 00:31:00,169
are talking about two different numbers

720
00:30:57,070 --> 00:31:02,919
basic questions are they even supposed

721
00:31:00,169 --> 00:31:06,529
to represent the same information

722
00:31:02,919 --> 00:31:09,259
sometimes numbers may be called the same

723
00:31:06,529 --> 00:31:09,540
thing but they're actually not supposed

724
00:31:09,259 --> 00:31:12,150
to

725
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:14,460
represent the same thing at all so an

726
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:18,300
example would be that you know people

727
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:20,160
may be just saying sign ups but maybe

728
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:22,230
the sign ups that are stored on sales

729
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:24,240
force on the Salesforce platform are

730
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:26,090
referring to sign ups that need a

731
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,960
customer success person to reach out

732
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:29,460
whereas the sign ups that would be

733
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:32,820
stored in your internal table would be

734
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:34,500
all sign ups ever so you know you're

735
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:37,230
both calling it sign ups but is it

736
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:40,680
actually all sign ups and the same

737
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:43,170
amount the other thing to think about is

738
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:45,450
I think this is actually super super

739
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:48,390
common but you know are they from the

740
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:50,460
same time frame and is your refresh data

741
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:52,230
refresh cadence for the two places that

742
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:55,140
you're looking for information similar

743
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:56,490
and that is I mean hands down

744
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:59,910
one of the most common things that

745
00:31:56,490 --> 00:32:02,010
happens that like one report could be

746
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:04,050
set to begin at the first of the month

747
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:07,470
the other report is set for the first

748
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:09,780
Monday of the month or like you know

749
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:11,160
they're set to different time zones just

750
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:14,250
just things like that like they're all

751
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:15,840
time frame related things and those

752
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:17,820
things you know again get it out of the

753
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:20,360
way quick because that is that is

754
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:23,550
usually a very common reason for

755
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:25,590
misalignment to occur and the last thing

756
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:26,700
here are sanity checklist wise is just

757
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:29,790
human error

758
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:31,860
you know there's I mean I think all of

759
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:34,080
us no matter how foolproof we make

760
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:37,080
something there's always gonna be some

761
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:38,490
unintended use there could be some typos

762
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,430
there could be some extra filters

763
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:43,920
there's just like basic things that are

764
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:48,090
unintended how you intention for them to

765
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:49,890
be used and then the last sort of

766
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:52,860
checklist before we get into the coding

767
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:54,810
is you know just understand understand

768
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:57,990
the data set and understand what the

769
00:32:54,810 --> 00:33:00,240
problem is before you fully begin so

770
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:02,670
here again the basic questions to ask

771
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,260
you know what rules where each of the

772
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:07,830
data sets built way like is it just

773
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:09,510
purely raw data and presented as is or

774
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:11,280
were there some transformations applied

775
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:13,800
were there some business rules applied

776
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:17,430
on top of it a lot of this information

777
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:20,669
is unfortunately tribal knowledge and

778
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:22,859
you again as a good data scientist

779
00:33:20,669 --> 00:33:24,690
and as a good citizen you have to you

780
00:33:22,859 --> 00:33:27,239
have to actually start documenting some

781
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:30,299
of these things so that other detectives

782
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:32,820
have an easier time and it's um it's

783
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:35,399
totally worth the time the other common

784
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:38,009
thing is the drain off the data set so

785
00:33:35,399 --> 00:33:40,259
you could very often have something

786
00:33:38,009 --> 00:33:42,779
where again they looked like they have

787
00:33:40,259 --> 00:33:45,059
the same number of columns but maybe

788
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:47,369
they're both aggregated at a completely

789
00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:50,100
different Lane and that could also

790
00:33:47,369 --> 00:33:52,739
result in some unintended things that

791
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:55,409
you can't see and finally is there a

792
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:57,149
pipeline issue again that's also very

793
00:33:55,409 --> 00:33:58,950
common that like you know the pipeline

794
00:33:57,149 --> 00:34:00,929
just breaks for a couple of hours or

795
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:02,759
something like that and you're missing

796
00:34:00,929 --> 00:34:07,889
data from a specific like chunk of time

797
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:13,799
or or something weird is going on so now

798
00:34:07,889 --> 00:34:17,909
let's sorry I just have some more okay

799
00:34:13,799 --> 00:34:21,480
so now let's actually let's actually get

800
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:23,849
into some code so here's what a dataset

801
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:25,500
looks like it has an ID column and

802
00:34:23,849 --> 00:34:26,940
obviously there might be other columns

803
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:29,190
as well but these are the relevant ones

804
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:31,500
we look at there's an odd order date

805
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:33,780
there's a region and there's a sales

806
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:38,159
amount and that's sort of the basic

807
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:40,290
thing that we're dealing with so the

808
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:42,089
most obvious check to start with when

809
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:44,520
you're comparing two different data sets

810
00:34:42,089 --> 00:34:46,679
to see what's going on with them you

811
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:48,809
know are they the same or not

812
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:52,109
after answering all those sanity checks

813
00:34:48,809 --> 00:34:54,690
that we just did the first thing is do

814
00:34:52,109 --> 00:34:56,309
they have the same number of rows that

815
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:58,710
can usually tell you a lot of what's

816
00:34:56,309 --> 00:35:01,829
going on and so you know the simple

817
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:03,900
thing there is just select count from

818
00:35:01,829 --> 00:35:05,640
from both of them compare that number of

819
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:07,140
course you might decide to add like a

820
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:09,809
where clause if you're looking for a

821
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:11,160
specific month or a specific region or

822
00:35:09,809 --> 00:35:13,260
whatever the difference is showing up

823
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:17,670
but this is your absolute bare minimum

824
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:19,170
starting point after that if they if

825
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:21,540
they don't actually have the same number

826
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:23,780
of rows first thing is let's look for

827
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:27,000
missing information so in this example

828
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:29,700
the ID was a unique column so we're

829
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:33,290
basically gonna look for we're gonna

830
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:35,380
find the missing ids and we're gonna say

831
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:37,180
you know which eye

832
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:40,030
we're going to do a full full join of

833
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:42,130
the two tables and if the ID is null in

834
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:44,980
one of the tables that's the table that

835
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:46,750
it's missing from so this you know the

836
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:48,970
second query should essentially give you

837
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:51,480
a list of all the missing IDs and which

838
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:54,610
ID which table they're missing from and

839
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:56,260
once you have that information we will

840
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:57,700
discuss few different ways you can go

841
00:35:56,260 --> 00:36:02,710
about it but that should give you some

842
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:05,440
information the next step you know I

843
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:08,710
think even if you did find some missing

844
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:10,570
information I think it's still as long

845
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:12,940
as like I think it's still useful to

846
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:15,100
look for duplicates anyways because

847
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:17,770
again pipelines do weird things and

848
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:21,640
funky stuff can happen so here again

849
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:25,960
you're simply you know getting all the

850
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:28,090
all the I all the IDS you know grouping

851
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:30,760
the IDs to get a count and you're

852
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:33,070
basically looking for any ID that has a

853
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:36,180
count greater than one from each table

854
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:38,770
and you're unioning those two those two

855
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:40,150
sub-queries and getting your final

856
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:43,390
result that gives you the final answer

857
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:45,760
so this way again you'll have one one

858
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:47,620
result that will give you all the

859
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,410
duplicate IDs that are that are missing

860
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:52,930
so that are that are duplicates and and

861
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:55,420
which table there are duplicate in so

862
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:56,620
these these queries that we have so far

863
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:58,420
like of course there could be a lot of

864
00:36:56,620 --> 00:37:00,640
like extra clauses that you can build

865
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:02,560
into it but just kind of sharing it as

866
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:04,390
examples of life starting points of how

867
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:09,490
to start even thinking about some of

868
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:12,460
these issues next and you know sort of

869
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:15,250
the last sequel level check that I

870
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:18,520
talked about is just doing a check at

871
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:20,470
the dimension level so here is where it

872
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:21,970
gets interesting and where your

873
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:23,890
familiarity with the data can really

874
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:25,450
help but again in this example you're

875
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:28,810
new to the companies you have no idea

876
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:30,490
what's going on once you've sort of

877
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:34,060
eliminated some of the basic things you

878
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:36,250
want to start breaking things down by

879
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:40,950
you know one dimension at a time and

880
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:44,020
seeing you know is there a case where

881
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:47,560
things are consistently off across

882
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:48,430
dimensions or it's only one dimension

883
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:50,950
where there's something

884
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:53,700
gone wrong so like for example in this

885
00:37:50,950 --> 00:38:00,130
query I am looking essentially for

886
00:37:53,700 --> 00:38:03,280
regions there the region the sales the

887
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:05,020
sum of the sales for a region in table

888
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:08,500
one is different from the sum of the

889
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:11,890
sales in region two and in the same in

890
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:14,020
table 2 for the same region and this so

891
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:16,330
that's why I'm only doing like I'm only

892
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:19,360
looking for I'm only gonna it's only

893
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:21,250
gonna result in the rows that have that

894
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:23,860
have a difference and that is

895
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:26,080
immediately gonna tell me like if I see

896
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:28,450
all the regions then the problem is

897
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:30,400
either on a different dimension or

898
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:33,430
there's something else going on but if

899
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:35,650
this data shows me that oh only region

900
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:37,240
that has a problem is say the East

901
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:39,310
region or something then that

902
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:41,410
immediately tells me that the rest of my

903
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:43,150
pipeline is probably fine or my rest of

904
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:45,700
my feature definition is fine but at

905
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:48,670
least I know to narrow down that I have

906
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:50,350
to go do something about the East region

907
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:52,510
because that's where my problem is

908
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:54,700
showing up and like you like I said like

909
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:56,710
if if the if all the regions are equally

910
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:58,480
off then you break it down by a

911
00:38:56,710 --> 00:39:01,180
different dimension maybe it's the

912
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:03,760
product or something else but the point

913
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:07,270
is to keep doing those cuts until you

914
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:12,100
find something where you have a step to

915
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:14,560
dig further so this is you know these

916
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:16,840
are obviously I mean these examples have

917
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:18,880
this example has been simplified to sort

918
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:22,150
of give you a give you a taste of what

919
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:25,240
what what this looks like but you know I

920
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:27,130
I expect that people will as they become

921
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:29,410
more familiar with datasets they will

922
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:31,720
build their own scripts and write their

923
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:35,800
own queries to resolve common problems

924
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:37,990
and I think you know you should ideally

925
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:40,150
make these things modular so that you

926
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:43,720
can convert those code snippets easily

927
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:45,850
and share them with the you know share

928
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:47,530
them save them converted into reusable

929
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:50,530
modules so that you can like change

930
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:52,750
change things and and kind of go around

931
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:54,610
it and you can also convert some of

932
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:57,220
these things to visualizations to help

933
00:39:54,610 --> 00:40:00,070
you spot errors faster so for example

934
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:01,510
like in my you know in in in one of the

935
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:01,990
places I used to work at like I had

936
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:04,300
these

937
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:07,080
like just kind of ready to go cuz Elvis

938
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:09,490
knew where the pipeline would break and

939
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:11,140
it was a different team that had to fix

940
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:12,790
the pipeline so I just had to provide

941
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:15,490
them the proof that the pipeline was

942
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:17,830
broken so I had these scripts is ready

943
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:19,390
to go and when it wasn't a pipeline

944
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:21,340
issue when it was a feature definition

945
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:22,450
issue I would have like I would go

946
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:23,800
through this because that was the most

947
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:25,510
common thing and then I would have

948
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:28,210
something else to go through those I

949
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:29,860
knew that okay for feature stuff I write

950
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:32,580
different scripts or I have different

951
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:35,200
filters or some or something like that

952
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:37,090
and yeah you can you can kind of like

953
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:42,220
build on these as you as you get more

954
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:44,619
comfortable with the data so to wrap it

955
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:49,060
up I think one of the things to keep in

956
00:40:44,619 --> 00:40:50,680
mind is that you know as as we saw

957
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:53,680
through a bit of the examples like

958
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:58,210
prevention is a lot better than cure and

959
00:40:53,680 --> 00:41:01,000
you know a lot of the sanity checks that

960
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:02,619
we do before we before we do anything

961
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,210
before we look into stuff like a lot of

962
00:41:02,619 --> 00:41:06,280
it comes into things that are easy to

963
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:08,500
prevent if you do it in the beginning so

964
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:12,040
if you're as a company committed to

965
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:14,230
reconciling on terminologies documenting

966
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:16,450
stuff making sure everybody is data

967
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:19,030
literate it makes your life and

968
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:21,100
everybody's life a whole lot easier and

969
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:23,320
I also think like automating stuff is

970
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:25,690
extremely important like you should not

971
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:28,690
have to do anything manually if you're

972
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:31,359
if you're doing it more than once then

973
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:32,770
by all means be absolutely lazy and just

974
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:34,960
do it once then never do it again

975
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:37,660
and automate it because I think I think

976
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:40,680
that those that actually allows you to

977
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:42,850
be be more efficient in what's going on

978
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:45,900
the other thing is just simplify your

979
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:49,780
curated data sets so anything that has

980
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:52,119
way too much information that you don't

981
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:54,880
use is going to be very hard to debug

982
00:41:52,119 --> 00:41:56,530
when a problem occurs because you just

983
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,810
have so many different things to look at

984
00:41:56,530 --> 00:42:01,450
so keep it extremely simple keep it

985
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:04,750
aggregated to a level that you expect it

986
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:07,240
to work at and that way also specially

987
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:08,950
like like at my company we use snowflake

988
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:10,990
which is which is super fast but like

989
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:13,780
you know some of the old data warehouses

990
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:14,720
it takes a while to run some queries so

991
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:17,330
it makes sense

992
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:19,490
if you have something that's you know

993
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:22,670
simple and aggregated so that you only

994
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:25,310
go up one level if you if you pinpointed

995
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:27,740
the problem to like one one section and

996
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:30,560
yeah I think again like it's very

997
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:33,260
important to have an actual governance

998
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:34,880
standard and you know some sort of a

999
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:36,770
philosophy about who owns ooh art who

1000
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,960
owns which part getting broken who's in

1001
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:41,869
charge of reporting things things like

1002
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:43,849
that I think are extremely are extremely

1003
00:42:41,869 --> 00:42:46,070
required and you should also have an

1004
00:42:43,849 --> 00:42:49,070
audit process so at some point you

1005
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:52,880
should do some kind of a quality or you

1006
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:54,920
know a data cleanup hackathon that that

1007
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:58,190
is that is able to sort of address some

1008
00:42:54,920 --> 00:43:02,420
of these some of these issues so yeah I

1009
00:42:58,190 --> 00:43:03,800
guess you know overall like I think sort

1010
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:05,780
of wrapping up the philosophy and the

1011
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:07,760
methodology like you know keep keep

1012
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:10,190
breaking down the problem into smaller

1013
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:12,140
parts until you are able to fully

1014
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:16,310
isolate where differences are occurring

1015
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:18,410
and bad bad data is creeping up and you

1016
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:20,450
know the the the truth is out there

1017
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:22,640
somewhere like you just you just have to

1018
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:26,060
sort of like keep finding a way to get

1019
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:27,710
to it and yeah with that I I just wanted

1020
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:30,680
to leave you all with some additional

1021
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:32,480
research and reference material I think

1022
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:34,520
there are some great thoughts that

1023
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:36,770
people shared about like bad data and

1024
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:39,290
also how to think like Sherlock Holmes

1025
00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:42,200
which you can apply for other things as

1026
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:44,180
well and I also linked my own talk about

1027
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:47,839
thoughtful analytics in case anybody is

1028
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:50,450
interested it is also on my website and

1029
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:53,000
yeah that's that's that's that's it for

1030
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:55,670
today thanks so much for attending a

1031
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:58,099
special thank you for asthma and data

1032
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:59,990
umbrella for hosting me this is this is

1033
00:43:58,099 --> 00:44:02,960
extremely fun I haven't actually done a

1034
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:05,540
technical webinar ever so this is

1035
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:08,150
solving in-person services 10 fun for me

1036
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:10,849
I hope you found the content useful I

1037
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:13,070
will be taking some questions now but

1038
00:44:10,849 --> 00:44:15,470
also keep in mind that data umbrella is

1039
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:17,150
going to publish a recording of this on

1040
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:19,430
their website as well as on their

1041
00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:21,940
YouTube channel and I'll be doing the

1042
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:24,260
same as well in about a month's time so

answer any questions any questions or

1052
00:44:52,999 --> 00:45:02,719
any observations anything else that

1053

you've noticed that helps you do we have

1054
00:45:02,719 --> 00:45:07,940
Rene Phillips here who is like she's

1055
00:45:06,229 --> 00:45:10,609
like very very involved in Postgres

1056
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:17,660
women SQL and in the conference

1057
00:45:10,609 --> 00:45:19,400
organizing the conference as well and do

1058
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:22,549
you show me do you want to put in the

1059
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:25,099
chat the link to the careers page for

1060
00:45:22,549 --> 00:45:36,529
Komodo health yeah let me let me quickly

1061
00:45:25,099 --> 00:45:39,709
grab that thank you

1062
00:45:36,529 --> 00:45:43,309
what's the hardest data quality problem

1063
00:45:39,709 --> 00:45:46,849
I have faced um that's to be very very

1064
00:45:43,309 --> 00:45:47,479
frank it's so I go with the hardest one

1065
00:45:46,849 --> 00:45:50,239
first

1066
00:45:47,479 --> 00:45:53,059
honestly it's convincing people that

1067
00:45:50,239 --> 00:45:55,430
it's important which which should not be

1068
00:45:53,059 --> 00:45:57,380
a thing but you know I think I think

1069
00:45:55,430 --> 00:46:00,109
some organizations have very good data

1070
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:01,940
hygiene and they know sort of all the

1071
00:46:00,109 --> 00:46:03,890
downstream issues that it can cause if

1072
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:06,650
you don't notice these things up front

1073
00:46:03,890 --> 00:46:09,559
but I did work in an organization once

1074
00:46:06,650 --> 00:46:10,910
where it was just it was you know there

1075
00:46:09,559 --> 00:46:13,880
was just absolutely like there was a

1076
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:15,769
wild wild west of like everybody just

1077
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:18,709
kind of do whatever and you'll figure it

1078
00:46:15,769 --> 00:46:20,779
out later and it caught it cause it was

1079
00:46:18,709 --> 00:46:22,959
so costly because it took so many people

1080
00:46:20,779 --> 00:46:25,279
so much time to try to like you know

1081
00:46:22,959 --> 00:46:29,779
reset some of the things that were just

1082
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:34,160
very very bad and yeah that was that was

1083
00:46:29,779 --> 00:46:39,380
pretty hard the most fun one I would say

1084
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:41,980
is yeah I you know I I just I like I

1085
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:47,020
like investigating stuff like

1086
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:49,510
i i like having an analysis that I trust

1087
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:52,330
so if there's something that comes up

1088
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:55,900
which you know which I'm confused like

1089
00:46:52,330 --> 00:46:59,410
oh my why'd you know why does this seem

1090
00:46:55,900 --> 00:47:01,480
odd sometimes that entire investigation

1091
00:46:59,410 --> 00:47:03,580
is because I think there's bad data and

1092
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:06,420
maybe at the end of it I prove that it's

1093
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:09,070
not like this is legitimately what our

1094
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:10,750
what our data is telling us that's I

1095
00:47:09,070 --> 00:47:13,030
think that's still a good outcome for me

1096
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:14,890
because I think that whole process makes

1097
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:17,470
me understand the data a lot better

1098
00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:19,840
makes me trust different parts of it a

1099
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:21,280
lot better so I I do find it fun to have

1100
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:24,240
these challenges every once in a while

1101
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:31,090
because I think it allows me to engage

1102
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:32,950
with things more Ruchika us how do you

1103
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:35,920
take care of bias in the data when

1104
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:37,000
historically there has been a lot so

1105
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,160
that's an interesting that's an

1106
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,350
interesting question I guess my first

1107
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:43,840
question to that would be like how do

1108
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:45,430
you know there is there is bias or is it

1109
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:55,660
just that you're trying to make sure

1110
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:58,000
that there is there is no bias so Arouca

1111
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:59,920
I don't know if you had a specific sort

1112
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,230
of thing in mind but I guess I'll just

1113
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:04,990
give you I guess I'll just give you a

1114
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:08,830
general making sure that there's no bias

1115
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:12,280
okay yeah I guess I guess for me I am

1116
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:15,750
always trying to look at the use case I

1117
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:18,520
think you know whatever I'm trying to do

1118
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:23,350
whatever I'm trying to get to as an

1119
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:25,030
answer like I think honestly for me it

1120
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:27,700
really comes down to talking to a lot of

1121
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:29,890
people and kind of almost poking holes

1122
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:33,760
at a problem like what are the what are

1123
00:48:29,890 --> 00:48:35,710
the ways this could go wrong well you

1124
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:38,500
know we're we're doing something

1125
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:41,859
unintended I actually in one of the

1126
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:43,540
companies I used to actually sit go and

1127
00:48:41,859 --> 00:48:45,580
sit with the customer support teams

1128
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:47,350
occasionally and like get them to tell

1129
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:48,640
me like you know just show me examples

1130
00:48:47,350 --> 00:48:52,300
of what people are complaining about

1131
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:53,830
about our software and you know that

1132
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:55,810
actually started an initiative where we

1133
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:57,430
would we would flag things which

1134
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:58,990
seem like people just didn't trust

1135
00:48:57,430 --> 00:49:01,000
something that was happening like they

1136
00:48:58,990 --> 00:49:03,580
didn't they didn't think it made sense

1137
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:06,610
and some of those things were I mean

1138
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:08,020
there was like it was just there was no

1139
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:09,760
reason for them to not trust it but

1140
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:11,320
other things like it made sense and we

1141
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:13,480
did actually do some investigations

1142
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:14,980
where they're like yeah the reason why

1143
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:17,080
this person said this looks suspicious

1144
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:18,520
makes sense because there is there is

1145
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:21,790
something odd happening there and that

1146
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:23,920
doesn't make sense

1147
00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:25,960
milena what tools you use to clean up

1148
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:29,290
the data so I think that for me depends

1149
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:32,200
on what what I'm actually using so I

1150
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:35,800
typically access most of my data in a

1151
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:39,580
sequel warehouse and I end up doing a

1152
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:42,730
lot of it there if I have exported it

1153
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:45,400
out then I usually use art but again

1154
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:47,200
that's just my preference my my entire

1155
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:49,060
team is very much on the Pythian

1156
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:54,340
bandwagon and that's that's what they

1157
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:56,320
use yeah what additional functionality

1158
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:59,020
and unique capabilities does snowflake

1159
00:49:56,320 --> 00:50:01,210
provide oh I have to tell you I'm very

1160
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:03,700
biased towards snowflake I am a huge

1161
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:05,380
huge snowflake fan girl when I was

1162
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:06,910
joining Komodo health actually one of

1163
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:08,800
the first question I ask them is do you

1164
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:10,960
have snowflake and they said yes and so

1165
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:12,280
I joined because my previous company did

1166
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:14,890
not have snowflake and I was very

1167
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:16,330
annoyed by that for the two and a half

1168
00:50:14,890 --> 00:50:18,910
years that I work there

1169
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:22,510
snowflake is just really fast it's it's

1170
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:24,820
it's such a it's I mean yeah I I'm like

1171
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:27,790
I said I am amazingly I like to spend

1172
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:30,070
less time doing stuff so I was on

1173
00:50:27,790 --> 00:50:31,480
hurting for awhile and those things used

1174
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:33,700
to take me like 20 minutes to run a

1175
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:36,090
query and then in snowflake that same

1176
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:41,260
query would take a less than a minute

1177
00:50:36,090 --> 00:50:45,940
say I I I'm not paid by them but I do

1178
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:48,310
like their to me quite a bit I have a

1179
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:50,230
question for you I was thinking when

1180
00:50:48,310 --> 00:50:51,040
you're working with that many millions

1181
00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:54,070
of Records

1182
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:57,000
do you often find those cases that are

1183
00:50:54,070 --> 00:50:59,530
you know just a handful that are

1184
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:01,540
problematic and heavy it's is it like

1185
00:50:59,530 --> 00:51:02,650
finding a needle in a haystack or is it

1186
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:04,540
something that really just sort of

1187
00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:08,470
breaks all your programs because it's

1188
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:09,580
that exception yeah that's a that's a

1189
00:51:08,470 --> 00:51:13,240
great question so

1190
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:15,160
you know some of the so some of the most

1191
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:16,570
like often that I did these

1192
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:19,090
investigations that actually at

1193
00:51:16,570 --> 00:51:24,730
Salesforce where the platform that I

1194
00:51:19,090 --> 00:51:27,220
worked on had 340 million users so it

1195
00:51:24,730 --> 00:51:29,260
was obviously yeah it was it was just a

1196
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:31,930
 ton of junk data that was generated

1197
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:34,090
for Ford the stuff that we were using

1198
00:51:31,930 --> 00:51:35,710
and that was the time I did not have

1199
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:38,830
snowflake so my queries would actually

1200
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:42,370
take longer and then like that's the

1201
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:43,870
thing that I got to like I think like we

1202
00:51:42,370 --> 00:51:45,760
had a little bit of an understanding of

1203
00:51:43,870 --> 00:51:49,660
like I think when I was a kissed able to

1204
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:51,940
explain like here's why this data is

1205
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:54,670
always gonna be slightly shifted from

1206
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:56,590
this other data then people have less of

1207
00:51:54,670 --> 00:51:59,740
a problem like if they if I if I've done

1208
00:51:56,590 --> 00:52:03,040
that true once where it's like you know

1209
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:05,230
we expect there to be a 1% difference

1210
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:07,960
when you're pulling it from this source

1211
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:09,220
versus this source because you know

1212
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,540
they're they're out of sync they're

1213
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:12,130
never gonna be insane there's always

1214
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:13,690
gonna be a little bit of lag here or

1215
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:16,870
something like that like then people

1216
00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:18,910
have then if people understand it

1217
00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:20,590
they're okay with it but if that shift

1218
00:52:18,910 --> 00:52:23,560
ever like really changes like suddenly

1219
00:52:20,590 --> 00:52:25,210
even from 1% it goes to 1.5 like if it's

1220
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:29,010
crossed a threshold that we have

1221
00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:31,450
established as unknown then it warrants

1222
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:32,590
investigation like what's what's going

1223
00:52:31,450 --> 00:52:34,300
on like is this something that's

1224
00:52:32,590 --> 00:52:36,780
breaking or is this really my data

1225
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:39,850
changing and I think in that like again

1226
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:43,180
the more time I spent with that data the

1227
00:52:39,850 --> 00:52:44,560
more sort of checks I built in one thing

1228
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:47,260
I forgot to mention but like some of

1229
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:50,050
these queries that I had pulled put out

1230
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:52,480
I actually you know got some of the data

1231
00:52:50,050 --> 00:52:54,220
engineers to convert them into alerts so

1232
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:57,070
that if some of those checks didn't pass

1233
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:59,800
it would actually like things that I

1234
00:52:57,070 --> 00:53:01,750
knew were to be true like I would have

1235
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:03,760
them coded into the things so that

1236
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:05,770
before that data was even published it

1237
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:07,570
would go through all of those checks and

1238
00:53:05,770 --> 00:53:09,730
if something failed it would not publish

1239
00:53:07,570 --> 00:53:11,470
that data set so that then I could go

1240
00:53:09,730 --> 00:53:13,330
and look at it and be like does this

1241
00:53:11,470 --> 00:53:15,610
look fine or does this not does this

1242
00:53:13,330 --> 00:53:16,990
require extra investigation and I think

1243
00:53:15,610 --> 00:53:18,880
that was really helpful because then

1244
00:53:16,990 --> 00:53:21,130
you're not on a totally by goose chase

1245
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:24,660
you're actually you know you're saying

1246
00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:27,040
like sure here's what went wrong in here

1247
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:30,240
that's what in pharma we used to call

1248
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:37,210
those edit chicks yeah the same thing

1249
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:39,160
yeah yeah cuz we have another couple of

1250
00:53:37,210 --> 00:53:41,400
minutes does anybody else have any

1251
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:41,400
