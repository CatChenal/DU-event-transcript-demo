advice</text><text start="190.01" dur="4.53">that I wish that I had if you are big on</text><text start="193.43" dur="5.58">social media or whatever</text><text start="194.54" dur="7.89">I am a spittle on all of them so you can</text><text start="199.01" dur="7.53">find me there um I have learned a lot</text><text start="202.43" dur="6.66">from my many many many career mistakes</text><text start="206.54" dur="5.25">and I want to share those with you today</text><text start="209.09" dur="5.28">so that you can avoid leaking those same</text><text start="211.79" dur="5.55">mistakes that I did and also hopefully</text><text start="214.37" dur="5.7">just learned some advice as well I do</text><text start="217.34" dur="4.35">want to say before it I start that I</text><text start="220.07" dur="3.27">know that I am in a position of</text><text start="221.69" dur="3.81">privilege as a professional developer</text><text start="223.34" dur="4.62">and a white woman who is college</text><text start="225.5" dur="4.32">educated and mid-career so I&amp;#39;m coming</text><text start="227.96" dur="4.14">from that perspective and I know that I</text><text start="229.82" dur="5.64">cannot represent all different career</text><text start="232.1" dur="6.18">experiences in this one talk so want to</text><text start="235.46" dur="4.08">put that up front that being said I want</text><text start="238.28" dur="5.79">to talk a little bit about my background</text><text start="239.54" dur="6.72">just as free me here so I did not know</text><text start="244.07" dur="5.19">what coding was until I was a sophomore</text><text start="246.26" dur="6.36">in college I took a computer science</text><text start="249.26" dur="7.289">class thinking that I was going to learn</text><text start="252.62" dur="5.67">how to format Microsoft Word documents I</text><text start="256.549" dur="5.461">thought that&amp;#39;s what computer science was</text><text start="258.29" dur="6.57">and so instead I fell into this magical</text><text start="262.01" dur="4.8">world of typing something into a</text><text start="264.86" dur="2.58">computer in Python and getting something</text><text start="266.81" dur="2.719">else</text><text start="267.44" dur="5.689">out</text><text start="269.529" dur="5.64">and that being said I started to take</text><text start="273.129" dur="4.77">more computer science classes thinking I</text><text start="275.169" dur="4.92">was going to do that as my major or</text><text start="277.899" dur="5.61">minor or something along those lines and</text><text start="280.089" dur="5.37">then a little bit later I had really</text><text start="283.509" dur="5.34">imposter that had impostor syndrome and</text><text start="285.459" dur="4.86">I quit I thought that I just wasn&amp;#39;t good</text><text start="288.849" dur="3.03">at programming I thought it wasn&amp;#39;t for</text><text start="290.319" dur="5.73">me I thought I found out about it too</text><text start="291.879" dur="6.39">late and so I left and so two classes</text><text start="296.049" dur="6.72">into computer science in college and I</text><text start="298.269" dur="7.82">quit programming I accidentally became a</text><text start="302.769" dur="5.64">software engineer though the next year I</text><text start="306.089" dur="4.66">learned that I could automate a lot of</text><text start="308.409" dur="3.81">my own job using Python and so I&amp;#39;m glad</text><text start="310.749" dur="3.27">he&amp;#39;s knocking to Python people tonight</text><text start="312.219" dur="4.37">because Python is where I started my</text><text start="314.019" dur="2.57">career and</text><text start="318.27" dur="5.13">again it felt magical for a second time</text><text start="321.3" dur="4.17">I was able to do a lot of the automated</text><text start="323.4" dur="4.83">or the things that I was doing manually</text><text start="325.47" dur="7.44">in an automated way so as opposed to</text><text start="328.23" dur="6.42">accidental so two potential ways to</text><text start="332.91" dur="4.56">learn to code I have been through both</text><text start="334.65" dur="7.35">of them both in dropping out of CS and</text><text start="337.47" dur="7.23">then also in self teaching most of code</text><text start="342" dur="4.92">especially web development and then the</text><text start="344.7" dur="4.2">third way is through a boot camp for</text><text start="346.92" dur="2.4">most people and so I&amp;#39;ve been teaching at</text><text start="348.9" dur="3.66">GA</text><text start="349.32" dur="5.55">for the last three years in all sorts of</text><text start="352.56" dur="5.13">roles there so can definitely speak to</text><text start="354.87" dur="6.6">that as well and have taught hundreds of</text><text start="357.69" dur="6.48">students to do that um I have made so</text><text start="361.47" dur="5.07">many mistakes as this slide says I&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="364.17" dur="4.2">trusted the wrong people stayed in toxic</text><text start="366.54" dur="4.62">environments taking the wrong job then</text><text start="368.37" dur="5.4">way underpaid and under titled and his</text><text start="371.16" dur="4.32">points in my career as well but I&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="373.77" dur="3.87">also done some things right which is</text><text start="375.48" dur="5.7">probably why I&amp;#39;m talking to you right</text><text start="377.64" dur="5.73">now and I&amp;#39;ve been so lucky to have grown</text><text start="381.18" dur="4.32">a pretty significant online following</text><text start="383.37" dur="5.28">and just for context because I think if</text><text start="385.5" dur="5.88">this is relevant to the discussion that</text><text start="388.65" dur="6.3">I&amp;#39;ve been able to build up a blog that</text><text start="391.38" dur="5.76">gets up to like three hundred thousand</text><text start="394.95" dur="4.83">reads a month and my social media</text><text start="397.14" dur="4.26">following is pretty sizable and so I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="399.78" dur="5.28">coming from that perspective in this</text><text start="401.4" dur="6.06">talk and talking about how those career</text><text start="405.06" dur="3.69">moves have really benefited me and how</text><text start="407.46" dur="3.42">hopefully some things that can be</text><text start="408.75" dur="4.32">actionable for you I will also be</text><text start="410.88" dur="4.95">looking at this Q&amp;amp;A so feel free to stop</text><text start="413.07" dur="5.85">me at any time um I&amp;#39;m pretty comfortable</text><text start="415.83" dur="5.82">with the talking teaching interruptions</text><text start="418.92" dur="9.03">thing just because again I do teach all</text><text start="421.65" dur="8.46">day so can definitely answer those okay</text><text start="427.95" dur="3.75">so the first part of this talk I want to</text><text start="430.11" dur="3.48">talk about the search itself so</text><text start="431.7" dur="2.69">searching for a job and what that looks</text><text start="433.59" dur="4.23">like</text><text start="434.39" dur="6.22">my first thing that I would say is to</text><text start="437.82" dur="5.19">find your niche find your sub industry</text><text start="440.61" dur="4.98">with intact that you want to work in and</text><text start="443.01" dur="4.35">so for my students I talked about</text><text start="445.59" dur="3.12">front-end development back-end</text><text start="447.36" dur="3.45">development you could be a full-stack</text><text start="448.71" dur="3.49">developer you could be in a UX to</text><text start="450.81" dur="4.21">engineer so if you really</text><text start="452.2" dur="5.49">just like html/css more than you like</text><text start="455.02" dur="3.57">javascript that could be a awesome path</text><text start="457.69" dur="3.03">for you as well</text><text start="458.59" dur="4.32">data science engineering management QA</text><text start="460.72" dur="4.53">engineer there&amp;#39;s so many different paths</text><text start="462.91" dur="4.86">out there and if you are somebody who is</text><text start="465.25" dur="3.9">a people person there is a space for you</text><text start="467.77" dur="3.33">within tech that was something that</text><text start="469.15" dur="3.78">terrified me before going into tech I</text><text start="471.1" dur="4.26">thought is a buncha introverts it&amp;#39;s not</text><text start="472.93" dur="4.91">there&amp;#39;s a place there as well for you</text><text start="475.36" dur="6.83">with engineering management or with</text><text start="477.84" dur="6.82">teaching which is also a career path or</text><text start="482.19" dur="4.81">even just being a developer being able</text><text start="484.66" dur="5.64">to interact with people is huge there as</text><text start="487" dur="5.52">well so first find what you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="490.3" dur="3.81">passionate about what fires you up what</text><text start="492.52" dur="3.33">makes him say because if it&amp;#39;s something</text><text start="494.11" dur="5.1">that you&amp;#39;re excited about you&amp;#39;re going</text><text start="495.85" dur="5.07">to be so much more likely to want to put</text><text start="499.21" dur="5.31">time into it and put work into it and</text><text start="500.92" dur="5.94">it&amp;#39;s gonna keep you motivated also to</text><text start="504.52" dur="5.01">the job search prioritize your values</text><text start="506.86" dur="4.56">success looks wildly different to</text><text start="509.53" dur="4.23">everyone this is a conversation I had</text><text start="511.42" dur="4.05">with some friends recently that success</text><text start="513.76" dur="4.59">to all of us look very different and</text><text start="515.47" dur="5.28">success to us personally looks very</text><text start="518.35" dur="4.2">different than what we projected on to</text><text start="520.75" dur="5.49">other people so for me success is</text><text start="522.55" dur="6.9">feeling stable and that I don&amp;#39;t have to</text><text start="526.24" dur="5.49">worry about my basic needs and feeling</text><text start="529.45" dur="3.63">fulfilled and feeling like I&amp;#39;m making a</text><text start="531.73" dur="3.48">difference in people&amp;#39;s lives which is</text><text start="533.08" dur="4.35">what I prioritize where is somebody else</text><text start="535.21" dur="4.41">they may prioritize money more or they</text><text start="537.43" dur="5.49">may prioritize work-life balance more</text><text start="539.62" dur="5.55">and right now at the position of a man</text><text start="542.92" dur="4.26">in life is work-life balance isn&amp;#39;t my</text><text start="545.17" dur="5.55">top priority but for something next to</text><text start="547.18" dur="6.57">me it could be and so have those values</text><text start="550.72" dur="4.47">and prioritize them they are totally</text><text start="553.75" dur="3.45">valid even if they are different than</text><text start="555.19" dur="5.27">somebody else&amp;#39;s I would even recommend</text><text start="557.2" dur="3.26">writing these down and</text><text start="560.72" dur="3.9">I&amp;#39;m thinking about them at every phase</text><text start="562.94" dur="3.209">of the search so the interview is make</text><text start="564.62" dur="4.5">sure that you&amp;#39;re asking the questions</text><text start="566.149" dur="4.74">there that you&amp;#39;re going to find out if</text><text start="569.12" dur="3.3">those things that you prioritize are</text><text start="570.889" dur="3.93">going to be prioritized by the company</text><text start="572.42" dur="4.95">when you&amp;#39;re negotiating you can</text><text start="574.819" dur="4.38">negotiate for more than salary - I used</text><text start="577.37" dur="3.779">to send ago sheet working seven to three</text><text start="579.199" dur="4.14">and said and nine to five you can</text><text start="581.149" dur="4.831">definitely negotiate for the things that</text><text start="583.339" dur="4.35">you prioritize so along those same lines</text><text start="585.98" dur="3.779">write down your goals and your</text><text start="587.689" dur="4.59">non-negotiables what are the things that</text><text start="589.759" dur="6.781">are hard limits for you that you for</text><text start="592.279" dur="6.031">sure are not going to accept in a job do</text><text start="596.54" dur="3.589">you need a certain salary do you need a</text><text start="598.31" dur="4.44">certain amount of work-life balance</text><text start="600.129" dur="5.38">superstructure hours a certain title</text><text start="602.75" dur="4.769">what hours the day do you work best what</text><text start="605.509" dur="3.81">type of team do you work best on do you</text><text start="607.519" dur="3.481">like big teams II like tight-knit teams</text><text start="609.319" dur="3.301">do you like working remote if you like</text><text start="611" dur="3.569">working in person all these questions</text><text start="612.62" dur="3.42">are so important and some of them are</text><text start="614.569" dur="2.96">going to be more important for people</text><text start="616.04" dur="4.71">than others</text><text start="617.529" dur="5.74">so definitely write them down so that</text><text start="620.75" dur="3.24">you can revisit them and have them there</text><text start="623.269" dur="3.451">as a reference</text><text start="623.99" dur="5.039">even when a job sounds awesome you can</text><text start="626.72" dur="3.75">still revisit that like oh okay even</text><text start="629.029" dur="3.18">though it sounds really awesome it might</text><text start="630.47" dur="6.989">not be a great fit for me for X and my</text><text start="632.209" dur="7.471">reasons online applications can suck I</text><text start="637.459" dur="7.261">have done hiring for a couple different</text><text start="639.68" dur="8.67">companies as an engineer and it can be a</text><text start="644.72" dur="6.44">total black hole to apply online because</text><text start="648.35" dur="5.4">there are hundreds of people filling out</text><text start="651.16" dur="4.659">applications for one slot and so getting</text><text start="653.75" dur="5.22">through that process is really really</text><text start="655.819" dur="4.83">really difficult it is so much easier to</text><text start="658.97" dur="3.989">get through that process if you know</text><text start="660.649" dur="4.141">somebody so you all are doing a huge</text><text start="662.959" dur="3.781">thing by just showing up tonight and</text><text start="664.79" dur="3.84">showing up to meetups in general it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="666.74" dur="3.92">going to allow you to make those</text><text start="668.63" dur="4.829">interpersonal connections so that</text><text start="670.66" dur="4.51">instead of applying font blindly and</text><text start="673.459" dur="4.711">doing the one-click applications or</text><text start="675.17" dur="6.63">whatever you&amp;#39;re actually putting a name</text><text start="678.17" dur="5.729">to a face um and there&amp;#39;s alternative</text><text start="681.8" dur="4.44">ways to do things - I got my first job</text><text start="683.899" dur="4.41">in tech by cold emailing a company and</text><text start="686.24" dur="5.12">being like your interests and mine</text><text start="688.309" dur="5.33">aligned I know Python</text><text start="691.36" dur="4.56">I also am interested in what you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="693.639" dur="4.32">doing will you hire me on as an intern</text><text start="695.92" dur="5.519">that&amp;#39;s how I got my first job in tech</text><text start="697.959" dur="5.55">and so um there are so many ways of</text><text start="701.439" dur="3.9">getting jobs it&amp;#39;s not just limited to</text><text start="703.509" dur="5.101">those online applications they&amp;#39;re really</text><text start="705.339"

dur="6.509">about portfolio sites is that they can</text><text start="735.6" dur="7.479">show everything about you in the way</text><text start="738.549" dur="7.38">that you want it to be showed so for me</text><text start="743.079" dur="4.591">I am less than I&amp;#39;m doing code side</text><text start="745.929" dur="3.75">projects right now I&amp;#39;m more big on doing</text><text

dur="5.73">long to the create at all just a couple</text><text start="771.189" dur="6.781">hours another one of my favorites is</text><text start="774.879" dur="6.591">from my old co-workers or Ben how burn</text><text start="777.97" dur="6.479">it&amp;#39;s a wild portfolio site it is so</text><text start="781.47" dur="5.289">untraditional and it actually plays</text><text start="784.449" dur="4.651">music and blows up the browser because</text><text start="786.759" dur="3.781">it&amp;#39;s so intensive on things on the speed</text><text start="789.1" dur="3.959">but it really shows

really out</text><text start="801.79" dur="4.769">there one way less simplistic than the</text><text start="804.1" dur="4.589">other ones um this one&amp;#39;s a full-blown</text><text start="806.559" dur="5.06">game and you play the game to get</text><text start="808.689" dur="7.23">through all the information about them</text><text start="811.619" dur="7.66">which is pretty wild so that&amp;#39;s a really</text><text start="815.919" dur="5.22">really impressive edge Keith&amp;#39;s one this</text><text start="819.279" dur="4.321">is another more minimalist one for a</text><text start="821.139" dur="3.901">designer which I really like as well so</text><text start="823.6" dur="3.84">so many different way</text><text start="825.04" dur="4.799">to create a portfolio say you don&amp;#39;t have</text><text start="827.44" dur="4.709">to go all in I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;m gonna get</text><text start="829.839" dur="4.261">asked a lot about portfolio sites is if</text><text start="832.149" dur="5.43">you are less of a front-end person so</text><text start="834.1" dur="5.489">your work is less visual and my</text><text start="837.579" dur="5.611">recommendation for that would be to have</text><text start="839.589" dur="6.031">case studies or descriptions of what</text><text start="843.19" dur="6.29">you&amp;#39;ve built so imagine it&amp;#39;s less visual</text><text start="845.62" dur="3.86">you can still display it on a portfolio</text><text start="859.41" dur="4.359">another thing that I really liked that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="861.88" dur="5.91">become more of a trend is having a</text><text start="863.769" dur="7.591">searching page or a hiring me page so</text><text start="867.79" dur="8.07">this is a Lea plan to use site and on</text><text start="871.36" dur="7.32">here she has a guide to what she&amp;#39;s</text><text start="875.86" dur="5.49">looking for in a company so like she</text><text start="878.68" dur="9.839">values diversity and work-life balance</text><text start="881.35" dur="9.51">and the ability to have a vacation and</text><text start="888.519" dur="5.101">that you&amp;#39;re not an agency or whatever</text><text start="890.86" dur="5.07">and then when she&amp;#39;s available where she</text><text start="893.62" dur="3.36">wants to live and about her and I</text><text start="895.93" dur="4.8">thought that this was really awesome</text><text start="896.98" dur="6.839">because it has exactly what she&amp;#39;s</text><text start="900.73" dur="4.979">prioritizing she is making the search</text><text start="903.819" dur="3.96">come to her instead of the other way</text><text start="905.709" dur="3.271">around so I found this really inspiring</text><text start="907.779" dur="3.511">it&amp;#39;s not something that I&amp;#39;ve ever</text><text start="908.98" dur="3.75">personally done but if I were to do a</text><text start="911.29" dur="3.39">full-blown job search I would probably</text><text start="912.73" dur="6.24">do something like that thought it was</text><text start="914.68" dur="6.24">really cool so that&amp;#39;s the first part of</text><text start="918.97" dur="4.229">the conversation is when you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="920.92" dur="6.63">searching for jobs in the first place</text><text start="923.199" dur="6.63">and then the next piece of the process</text><text start="927.55" dur="5.479">is once you&amp;#39;ve found some places that</text><text start="929.829" dur="5.791">you&amp;#39;re interested in is interviewing</text><text

signal that the</text><text start="940.42" dur="6.26">company itself is toxic too if they have</text><text start="943.029" dur="3.651">an interview process that</text><text start="947.54" dur="4.77">makes them look bad trust that if you</text><text start="951.019" dur="2.88">feel weird during that interview process</text><text start="952.31" dur="4.23">you probably do not want to work for</text><text start="953.899" dur="4.5">that company and I can tell you so many</text><text start="956.54" dur="4.02">horror stories I&amp;#39;m jumping through a</text><text start="958.399" dur="3.781">million hoops or being told by the</text><text start="960.56" dur="2.79">employee interviewing me that they</text><text start="962.18" dur="3.3">didn&amp;#39;t really like working at the</text><text start="963.35" dur="5.46">company and they just do it for the</text><text start="965.48" dur="5.909">status and then jumping through multiple</text><text start="968.81" dur="5.61">rounds of whiteboarding or having to</text><text start="971.389" dur="6.481">write code in a Google Doc yeah not</text><text start="974.42" dur="5.43">ideal and those are flags and maybe say</text><text start="977.87" dur="4.079">that maybe this company is not something</text><text start="979.85" dur="4.859">that I am the most interested in working</text><text start="981.949" dur="4.651">at also if they forget to email you back</text><text start="984.709" dur="3.481">or they&amp;#39;re really sloppy you&amp;#39;re be</text><text start="986.6" dur="3.359">scheduling things all the time that may</text><text start="988.19" dur="6">mean that they&amp;#39;re a little bit</text><text start="989.959" dur="6.81">inefficient or disorganized another</text><text start="994.19" dur="4.41">piece of advice is if you get asked a</text><text start="996.769" dur="6.991">technical question that you don&amp;#39;t know</text><text start="998.6" dur="8.429">the answer to spin that answer so if you</text><text start="1003.76" dur="5.939">are asked do you know react or you know</text><text start="1007.029" dur="6.481">x and y about react or Python or</text><text start="1009.699" dur="6.361">anything like that what you can say</text><text start="1013.51" dur="5.46">instead of oh I don&amp;#39;t know that instead</text><text start="1016.06" dur="6.87">show your growth mindset say I don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="1018.97" dur="5.79">know react yet but I do know you and I</text><text start="1022.93" dur="3.96">know that both use similar component</text><text start="1024.76" dur="4.77">architecture and I also love learning</text><text start="1026.89" dur="5.1">new things so I&amp;#39;d love to learn that on</text><text start="1029.53" dur="4.019">the job so it meant that you don&amp;#39;t know</text><text start="1031.99" dur="4.459">it because it&amp;#39;s easy enough to check in</text><text start="1033.549" dur="6.27">like by asking more detailed questions</text><text start="1036.449" dur="6.61">if you really do know that language or</text><text start="1039.819" dur="4.591">not but we can also always spin it to be</text><text start="1043.059" dur="3.24">a positive and show a growth mindset</text><text start="1044.41" dur="4.19">with questions that you don&amp;#39;t know the</text><text start="1046.299" dur="2.301">answer to</text><text start="1050.99" dur="5.25">so if you get asked technical questions</text><text start="1053.15" dur="5.51">show how you think so show your process</text><text start="1056.24" dur="5.67">maybe draw diagrams or pseudocode</text><text start="1058.66" dur="5.8">intermediate code explain pitfalls in</text><text start="1061.91" dur="5.25">that code you can definitely be vocal</text><text start="1064.46" dur="4.38">and ask clarifying questions as well</text><text start="1067.16" dur="3.39">because your that&amp;#39;s part of being a</text><text start="1068.84" dur="4.68">developer that&amp;#39;s a part of being in tech</text><text start="1070.55" dur="6.259">and so displaying your knowledge is</text><text start="1073.52" dur="3.289">really important</text><text start="1077.8" dur="6.3">another piece is always always always</text><text start="1081.07" dur="6">always always negotiate and you can</text><text start="1084.1" dur="6.68">negotiate anything so we mostly hear</text><text start="1087.07" dur="7.23">about salary negotiations which is so</text><text start="1090.78" dur="7.63">important especially as underrepresented</text><text start="1094.3" dur="8.25">folks and tech negotiating so important</text><text start="1098.41" dur="7.879">to get that up but also if there&amp;#39;s less</text><text start="1102.55" dur="7.229">wiggle room of salary you can always</text><text start="1106.289" dur="6.181">negotiate your role so maybe you can</text><text start="1109.779" dur="5.88">negotiate that one day a week is</text><text start="1112.47" dur="5.079">dedicated to learning or that you get to</text><text start="1115.659" dur="3.931">write one day a week for the company</text><text start="1117.549" dur="4.35">blog instead of doing development work</text><text start="1119.59" dur="6.35">or you could make it so that you work</text><text start="1121.899" dur="7.47">less hours or you can negotiate um</text><text start="1125.94" dur="5.41">remote days working remote a couple days</text><text start="1129.369" dur="3.75">a week which isn&amp;#39;t super relevant right</text><text start="1131.35" dur="3.51">now because all the days are remote but</text><text start="1133.119" dur="4.951">down the road that&amp;#39;ll be more relevant</text><text start="1134.86" dur="5.34">again you can negotiate benefits and</text><text start="1138.07" dur="6.479">then the classic which is compensation</text><text start="1140.2" dur="6.51">um I follow the following format when I</text><text start="1144.549" dur="4.141">negotiate so I thank them for the</text><text start="1146.71" dur="5.699">initial offer and tell them that I am</text><text start="1148.69" dur="5.55">excited about the initial offer I&amp;#39;m</text><text

I</text><text start="1162.519" dur="8.341">would like more days remote or I would</text><text start="1167.169" dur="5.431">like to be paid X&amp;amp;Y and then I like to</text><text start="1170.86" dur="4.169">list my wins that lead to me getting</text><text start="1172.6" dur="4.89">what I need get achieved for so I have</text><text start="1175.029" dur="8.791">demonstrated X&amp;amp;Y at my time at this</text><text start="1177.49" dur="9.439">company and then explained how I want to</text><text start="1183.82" dur="6.87">help the company in the future so my</text><text start="1186.929" dur="6.34">talent and X&amp;amp;Y will help you with the</text><text start="1190.69" dur="5.309">other things um seeing a couple</text><text start="1193.269" dur="5.01">questions in the chat and first off I</text><text start="1195.999" dur="4.351">will totally send out these slides after</text><text start="1198.279" dur="4.5">I&amp;#39;ll send them to a tie and you can send</text><text start="1200.35" dur="4.769">them out to you all I can also tweet</text><text start="1202.779" dur="3.99">them out if that is easier the other</text><text start="1205.119" dur="3.51">question that I&amp;#39;m seeing is how to get</text><text start="1206.769" dur="5.13">negotiate when the offer exceeds your</text><text start="1208.629" dur="5.25">expectations is at least try shoot a</text><text start="1211.899" dur="5.191">little bit higher see if they can wiggle</text><text start="1213.879" dur="5.28">but you could also negotiate for</text><text start="1217.09" dur="4.98">something different than compensation -</text><text start="1219.159" dur="4.561">so dig ease off or remote time or bonus</text><text start="1222.07" dur="5.9">or something along those lines but</text><text start="1223.72" dur="7.529">always negotiate get that number up if</text><text start="1227.97" dur="5.319">they&amp;#39;re giving you an offer that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="1231.249" dur="3.721">higher than your you expect that means</text><text start="1233.289" dur="4.411">that you are under valuing yourself in</text><text start="1234.97" dur="6.089">the first place so that would be my</text><text start="1237.7" dur="7.719">advice there</text><text start="1241.059" dur="6.941">another piece of advice is to never ever</text><text start="1245.419" dur="4.951">ever tell prospective employers how much</text><text start="1248" dur="4.26">you make right now in addition it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="1250.37" dur="5.25">illegal in a lot of places I&amp;#39;m not sure</text><text start="1252.26" dur="6.029">about New York specifically but in a lot</text><text start="1255.62" dur="5.61">of places it is illegal to ask how much</text><text start="1258.289" dur="4.52">you make within an interview if you do</text><text start="1261.23" dur="4.17">get asked this question</text><text start="1262.809" dur="4.061">spin it tell them a range of what you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="1265.4" dur="3.96">looking to make in your next position</text><text start="1266.87" dur="5.88">but it&amp;#39;s usually good to not put a</text><text start="1269.36"

ever</text><text start="1278.12" dur="5.34">tell anybody what you make right now</text><text start="1279.83" dur="5.4">that will lead to you being in a lower</text><text start="1283.46"

dur="3.721">asking you the same things that to me</text><text start="1475.509" dur="5.04">would be a red flag that they don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="1476.98" dur="5.819">value my time in fact I

would look different if</text><text start="1491.559" dur="3.901">you are looking for your first job in</text><text start="1493.12" dur="4.2">tech though I would say at that point to</text><text start="1495.46" dur="3.63">take as many interviews as possible so</text><text start="1497.32" dur="5.459">that you have practice interviewing um</text><text start="1499.09" dur="8.16">and then other red flags to look out for</text><text start="1502.779" dur="7.201">is disorganized process then displaying</text><text start="1507.25" dur="5.519">any toxicity during those interviews so</text><text

that&amp;#39;s like a huge red flag</text><text start="1515.25" dur="6.399">probably don&amp;#39;t need to explain that</text><text start="1517.149" dur="5.901">though um them asking questions that are</text><text start="1521.649" dur="4.051">legal</text><text start="1523.05" dur="5.61">all those types of things are red flags</text><text start="1525.7" dur="5.34">I would also say that them asking</text><text start="1528.66" dur="6.61">nitpicky weird overly technical</text><text start="1531.04" dur="6.51">questions that rely on rote memorization</text><text start="1535.27" dur="4.86">that for me is another red flag that</text><text start="1537.55" dur="4.14">they are not trusting my experience or</text><text start="1540.13" dur="3.48">that they want me to have things</text><text start="1541.69" dur="5.43">memorized that don&amp;#39;t really need to be</text><text start="1543.61" dur="6.33">memorized so those would be red flags</text><text start="1547.12" dur="5.52">that I would look out for when I am</text><text start="1549.94" dur="4.95">interviewing and then also a question</text><text start="1552.64" dur="3.18">about how I got my first internship

internship just by</text><text start="1563.46" dur="5.08">reaching out to different companies and</text><text start="1565.9" dur="6.81">cold emailing them honestly I would go</text><text

me and I would find their</text><text start="1578.68" dur="5.49">CEOs or whatever or partners and</text><text start="1581.71" dur="5.25">especially at startups and I would reach</text><text start="1584.17" dur="4.77">out to them just cold and send them</text><text start="1586.96" dur="4.68">messages which was definitely</text><text start="1588.94" dur="4.8">untraditional and probably is not the</text><text start="1591.64" dur="5.52">best way to go about things but I think</text><text start="1593.74" dur="5.73">it does say to network and use the</text><text start="1597.16" dur="4.02">people around you so if that&amp;#39;s going to</text><text start="1599.47" dur="5.48">meet ups and trying to meet people there</text><text start="1601.18" dur="3.77">or if it means</text><text start="1609.13" dur="2.03">ah</text><text start="1612.78" dur="4.23">using LinkedIn I&amp;#39;ve seen so many</text><text start="1615.179" dur="3.691">students be really really

dur="8.78">what was your most bones rate vehicles</text><text start="1626.67" dur="8.64">emails so it was actually one one</text><text start="1632.3" dur="5.53">because I only did it for that one</text><text start="1635.31" dur="4.89">company and they hired me like that same</text><text start="1637.83" dur="4.23">day which was absolutely it kind of</text><text start="1640.2" dur="4.29">should have been Fred flag probably in</text><text start="1642.06" dur="4.34">retrospect but I ended up working for</text><text start="1644.49" dur="4.29">there for like two and a half years um</text><text start="1646.4" dur="4.06">but I would have kept doing it I think</text><text start="1648.78" dur="3.27">even if it didn&amp;#39;t work out for that one</text><text start="1650.46" dur="3.69">but it was the first company that I that</text><text start="1652.05" dur="4.26">I did it for and then they were like</text><text start="1654.15" dur="4.17">come in tomorrow for an interview and</text><text start="1656.31" dur="6.75">then they hired me and I worked there</text><text start="1658.32" dur="6.36">for two and half years but um yeah I do</text><text start="1663.06" dur="5.52">not think that&amp;#39;s traditional by any</text><text start="1664.68" dur="5.73">means I I see my students see getting</text><text start="1668.58" dur="5.69">jobs mostly through LinkedIn and</text><text start="1670.41" dur="6.03">networking and then also through</text><text start="1674.27" dur="3.76">connections that they had from previous</text><text start="1676.44" dur="5.64">positions as well because those</text><text start="1678.03" dur="5.28">connections don&amp;#39;t go away how often does</text><text start="1682.08" dur="3">an engineer need to learn new</text><text start="1683.31" dur="3.12">technologies produce side projects using</text><text start="1685.08" dur="3.3">new technologies in order to help</text><text start="1686.43" dur="4.47">future-proof their career that&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="1688.38" dur="5.01">really good question but there are so</text><text start="1690.9" dur="4.32">many jobs out there using legacy tech</text><text start="1693.39" dur="3.99">like wasn&amp;#39;t there something with the</text><text start="1695.22" dur="5.15">unemployment system where they&amp;#39;re</text><text start="1697.38" dur="5.76">looking for for trend developers so I</text><text start="1700.37" dur="5.53">would say that even legacy tech is</text><text start="1703.14" dur="5.15">pretty important and that you should be</text><text start="1705.9" dur="2.39">able to</text><text start="1709.86" dur="8.08">leverage your experience with older</text><text start="1714.07" dur="5.73">technologies to newer ones as well</text><text start="1717.94" dur="4.23">because even though things change they</text><text start="1719.8" dur="3.99">don&amp;#39;t change that much and so even</text><text start="1722.17" dur="4.29">though I&amp;#39;m not writing Python 2 anymore</text><text start="1723.79" dur="7.59">like Python 3 is pretty similar so you</text><text start="1726.46" dur="7.2">can for write your skills there I would</text><text start="1731.38" dur="5.4">say that if you have time during your</text><text start="1733.66" dur="6.219">work day to play with different things</text><text start="1736.78" dur="5.529">that&amp;#39;s a great thing to do but</text><text start="1739.879" dur="3.72">all these things are connected and so I</text><text start="1742.309" dur="4.65">wouldn&amp;#39;t say that it&amp;#39;s a necessity</text><text start="1743.599" dur="5.88">especially when you do have a couple</text><text start="1746.959" dur="4.26">rolls under your belt to keep building</text><text start="1749.479" dur="3.54">those side projects I think that you</text><text start="1751.219" dur="3.81">need to prioritize what&amp;#39;s important to</text><text start="1753.019" dur="3.39">you and so what that is building side</text><text start="1755.029" dur="2.94">projects and learning new things and</text><text start="1756.409" dur="2.76">that&amp;#39;s totally valid but if you have</text><text start="1757.969" dur="3.99">other things in your life that you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="1759.169" dur="9.06">prioritizing instead I would prioritize</text><text start="1761.959" dur="8.94">that any text about handling</text><text start="1768.229" dur="4.89">conversations without equity I would say</text><text start="1770.899" dur="5.16">that it&amp;#39;s not guaranteed that that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="1773.119" dur="7.05">going to work out and so if you really</text><text start="1776.059" dur="7.14">really believe in the product then go</text><text start="1780.169" dur="5.07">for it but don&amp;#39;t take equity instead of</text><text start="1783.199" dur="3.72">a salary I&amp;#39;ve seen that all the time</text><text start="1785.239" dur="4.92">with people reaching out and Linkedin</text><text start="1786.919" dur="6.271">like you won&amp;#39;t get paid but you will</text><text start="1790.159" dur="5.16">have equity once their company starts</text><text start="1793.19" dur="5.25">making money do not do that under any</text><text start="1795.319" dur="6.78">circumstances that&amp;#39;s exploitation so</text><text start="1798.44" dur="5.939">messed up but handling conversations</text><text start="1802.099" dur="4.35">about equity you I have seen that</text><text start="1804.379" dur="4.08">companies will give you an option of</text><text start="1806.449" dur="4.05">either more equity with a slightly lower</text><text start="1808.459" dur="3.93">salary or a higher salary with slightly</text><text start="1810.499" dur="4.17">less equity I would say in that case</text><text start="1812.389" dur="4.74">it&amp;#39;s gonna depend on how long you see</text><text start="1814.669" dur="4.38">yourself staying at the company and how</text><text start="1817.129" dur="3.63">much you believe in their product I</text><text start="1819.049" dur="4.41">would say that it is definitely</text><text start="1820.759" dur="5.37">negotiable anything is negotiable and</text><text start="1823.459" dur="4.89">the numbers are gonna look really really</text><text start="1826.129" dur="5.67">small up front but if you do the math on</text><text start="1828.349" dur="6.65">their growth that tiny percent is going</text><text start="1831.799" dur="6.12">to grow over time there&amp;#39;s different</text><text

seed round startup is</text><text start="1843.739" dur="3.15">going to be able to give you a lot more</text><text start="1845.209" dur="4.55">equity but also gonna be a lot more</text><text start="1846.889" dur="5.34">risky whereas somebody who&amp;#39;s like a</text><text start="1849.759" dur="4.42">seriously startup who has a bunch of</text><text start="1852.229" dur="3.69">funding they can probably afford to pay</text><text start="1854.179" dur="3.99">more but there they have a lot less</text><text start="1855.919" dur="4.44">equity to give because they&amp;#39;ve already</text><text start="1858.169" dur="4.61">given a lot of their equity away for the</text><text start="1860.359" dur="2.42">most part</text><text start="1864.5" dur="7.809">cool other questions</text><text start="1868.95" dur="6.96">almost Oh SGA&amp;#39;s data analytics Congrats</text><text start="1872.309" dur="6.75">and long curve marketing business</text><text start="1875.91" dur="4.889">development but no tech work most the</text><text start="1879.059" dur="3.601">job postings require data analysis</text><text start="1880.799" dur="4.471">experience but how can you think you can</text><text start="1882.66" dur="4.35">sell your experience well I would say</text><text start="1885.27" dur="8.03">that you are probably using similar</text><text start="1887.01" dur="8.45">tools in your day-to-day now and you</text><text start="1893.3" dur="5.85">have relevant experiences as a</text><text start="1895.46" dur="5.04">professional and working in the field</text><text start="1899.15" dur="5.76">and you can definitely leverage that</text><text start="1900.5" dur="6.09">into your data analysis career um list</text><text start="1904.91" dur="6.51">of technologies that you&amp;#39;ve learned for</text><text start="1906.59" dur="7.59">sure but those skills definitely for a</text><text start="1911.42" dur="4.89">for one to another but I also not a data</text><text start="1914.18" dur="4.26">analyst or a marketer or a business</text><text start="1916.31" dur="4.38">development person so I can speak a</text><text start="1918.44" dur="4.05">little bit less to that if anybody else</text><text start="1920.69" dur="3.6">has more experience and those would be</text><text start="1922.49" dur="5.07">awesome to talk more about that in the</text><text start="1924.29" dur="6.24">jet yeah one thing I would say with with</text><text start="1927.56" dur="4.23">data analytics is if you&amp;#39;re if you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="1930.53" dur="3.27">still working at a company and you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="1931.79" dur="5.51">just doing the data analytics course</text><text start="1933.8" dur="6.71">part-time try to do a project

dur="5.4">try to work with someone on the team on</text><text start="1947.78" dur="4.32">whatever analytics team and just try to</text><text start="1949.7" dur="3.87">do a project cuz that&amp;#39;s one of the few</text><text start="1952.1" dur="3.3">projects you can actually do without</text><text start="1953.57" dur="3.21">messing anything up like if you&amp;#39;re some</text><text start="1955.4" dur="3.66">if you&amp;#39;re learning software developing a</text><text start="1956.78" dur="4.05">website chances are your company&amp;#39;s not</text><text start="1959.06" dur="5.07">gonna be like oh yeah you can just redo</text><text start="1960.83" dur="5.55">our website like um after taking like a</text><text start="1964.13" dur="4.83">small course but data analytics you can</text><text start="1966.38" dur="4.82">get a dump of a database or a CSV file</text><text start="1968.96" dur="5.27">and just crunch some numbers without</text><text start="1971.2" dur="5.47">affecting anything in the business so</text><text start="1974.23" dur="3.88">that&amp;#39;s what I think is the best with the</text><text start="1976.67" dur="3.78">data analytics or data science course</text><text start="1978.11" dur="5.01">and then that also says that you have</text><text start="1980.45" dur="4.29">professional data analysis experience</text><text start="1983.12" dur="5.19">Institute once you do that word project</text><text start="1984.74" dur="4.92">so awesome do you want to go through the</text><text start="1988.31" dur="2.88">rest of the slides and then do questions</text><text start="1989.66" dur="3.18">or I don&amp;#39;t know how many yeah I&amp;#39;ll do</text><text start="1991.19" dur="2.73">that I&amp;#39;ll keep going through the slides</text><text start="1992.84" dur="3.06">and then come back to the questions</text><text start="1993.92" dur="5.37">simply that mm I&amp;#39;ll come back to them</text><text start="1995.9" dur="6">but I don&amp;#39;t want to completely go off</text><text start="1999.29" dur="4.44">track I feel like I am it could be just</text><text start="2001.9" dur="5.64">a AMA that would be kind of fun too but</text><text start="2003.73" dur="6.39">I will go through my slides okay so the</text><text start="2007.54" dur="4.92">part three is code challenges which is</text><text start="2010.12" dur="5.31">another fun part of this whole process</text><text start="2012.46" dur="6.33">um I have a lot of experience with these</text><text start="2015.43" dur="7.08">both on the grading set and on the other</text><text start="2018.79" dur="5.61">side of doing them so first off you&amp;#39;d be</text><text start="2022.51" dur="3.38">shocked at how many people do not read</text><text start="2024.4" dur="3.86">the instructions</text><text start="2025.89" dur="4.47">and turn in something different than was</text><text start="2028.26" dur="5.22">asked for it so I would highly recommend</text><text start="2030.36" dur="6.09">reading the instructions potentially at</text><text start="2033.48" dur="4.95">multiple times and read the instructions</text><text start="2036.45" dur="2.97">again before you turn in the project to</text><text start="2038.43" dur="5.04">make sure that you did all the</text><text start="2039.42" dur="6.24">requirements you will be better than 90%</text><text start="2043.47" dur="5.72">of applicants if you just read the</text><text start="2045.66" dur="6.269">instructions I am guaranteeing this um</text><text start="2049.19" dur="5.17">another thing is if you are really</text><text start="2051.929" dur="4.261">really interested in the rule go above</text><text start="2054.36" dur="3.51">and beyond you don&amp;#39;t need to spend all</text><text start="2056.19" dur="3.33">your time on this by any means but</text><text start="2057.87" dur="5.22">adding something simple that was not</text><text start="2059.52"

something um</text><text start="2067.669" dur="5.321">don&amp;#39;t spend all your time on these don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="2070.169" dur="4.531">do unpaid work for companies but if

it do something above and beyond that</text><text start="2078.63" dur="5.279">will really really stand out compared to</text><text start="2081.24" dur="3.929">the other applicants this kind of goes</text><text start="2083.909" dur="3.121">without saying but follow the best</text><text start="2085.169" dur="5.791">practices for your language so if you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="2087.03"

dur="7.02">off in a Python heavy more data science</text><text start="2809.47" dur="8.61">just roll and then move more into web</text><text start="2813.04" dur="7.17">development because I enjoyed the

dur="7.35">starting my journey um okay so for SEI</text><text start="2963.74" dur="8.12">students i should say to do your</text><text start="2967.7" dur="7.5">homework and to do as much self teaching</text><text start="2971.86" dur="5.53">beforehand as possible first so that you</text><text start="2975.2" dur="3.8">know that you enjoy the subject and it&amp;#39;s</text><text

one thing with that</text><text start="3215.55" dur="3.52">sometimes you might have to start at the</text><text start="3217.359" dur="5.041">data analyst level and then work up to</text><text

don&amp;#39;t want to take it</text><text start="3388.9" dur="4.29">just so you&amp;#39;re always good at</text><text start="3391.359" dur="3.871">interviewing he does that every year</text><text start="3393.19" dur="3.69">he&amp;#39;ll apply to like five or ten jobs and</text><text start="3395.23" dur="3.66">just interview and if he gets a good</text><text start="3396.88" dur="4.919">offer he likes it you&amp;#39;ll go but</text><text start="3398.89" dur="5.88">otherwise you&amp;#39;ll just stay actually</text><text start="3401.799" dur="6.121">really smart I interviewing and tech is</text><text start="3404.77" dur="5.73">such a skill set in and of itself and so</text><text start="3407.92" dur="4.53">having to strengthen that skill set I</text><text start="3410.5" dur="3.599">think is a smart thing to do and I wish</text><text start="3412.45" dur="4.919">that I had actually interviewed more</text><text start="3414.099" dur="6.48">because I have barely interviewed and so</text><text start="3417.369" dur="5.91">it scares me more now yeah I mean it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="3420.579" dur="5.03">like a skill say you use like once every</text><text start="3423.279" dur="5.671">three to five years</text><text start="3425.609" dur="4.901">um I think is there so we&amp;#39;ll probably</text><text start="3428.95" dur="4.26">wrap up if anyone has any more questions</text><text start="3430.51" dur="15.72">you could just ask one or two more we</text><text start="3433.21" dur="18.869">can do that oh oh that&amp;#39;s just a question</text><text start="3446.23" dur="7.559">yeah just go so far I&amp;#39;ve not even an</text><text start="3452.079" dur="4.77">oversee that enough because you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="3453.789" dur="5.631">demonstrating your skill set in your</text><text start="3456.849" dur="6.301">explaining things in clean English which</text><text start="3459.42" dur="8.77">shows yours that you know your stuff so</text><text start="3463.15" dur="7.35">well so blogging a plus yeah my thing</text><text start="3468.19" dur="5.25">with with stuff like that like blogging</text><text start="3470.5" dur="4.98">or or giving a talk is that of the</text><text start="3473.44" dur="3.57">hundred people that wanna change jobs or</text><text start="3475.48" dur="3.15">want to be a data scientist very few</text><text start="3477.01" dur="3.539">people will do that right there&amp;#39;s like</text><text start="3478.63" dur="3.6">100 people that want to change in like</text><text start="3480.549" dur="4.141">two or three of those hundred will</text><text start="3482.23" dur="6.569">actually write blog posts or be active</text><text start="3484.69" dur="6.179">so doing what very few people are doing</text><text start="3488.799" dur="3.54">will help you stand out much more like</text><text start="3490.869" dur="3.45">everyone is applying to jobs online</text><text start="3492.339" dur="3.601">right like everyone&amp;#39;s doing that so</text><text start="3494.319" dur="4.111">you&amp;#39;re not gonna differentiate yourself</text><text start="3495.94" dur="3.929">but I guess a lot of people are blogging</text><text start="3498.43" dur="2.669">now cuz they&amp;#39;ll have more free time but</text><text start="3499.869" dur="2.251">yeah if you can write something</text><text start="3501.099" dur="3.241">interesting</text><text start="3502.12" dur="4.29">for example a lot of the stuff I see on</text><text start="3504.34" dur="4.65">media miss is just not that high quality</text><text start="3506.41" dur="4.68">it&amp;#39;s very short it&amp;#39;s very superficial so</text><text start="3508.99" dur="4.89">if you can really put the time in to</text><text start="3511.09" dur="6.03">like a unique project I saw someone do a</text><text start="3513.88" dur="5.1">project about he was in San Francisco</text><text start="3517.12" dur="4.14">and he would get a lot of parking</text><text start="3518.98" dur="4.95">tickets cuz he had a car and so he did a</text><text start="3521.26" dur="4.26">project where he he actually emailed San</text><text start="3523.93" dur="3.06">Francisco like the city government you</text><text start="3525.52" dur="3.69">can email sometimes government&amp;#39;s for</text><text start="3526.99" dur="4.65">data and he got all the data on parking</text><text start="3529.21" dur="3.87">tickets for the last 12 months and yeah</text><text start="3531.64" dur="4.98">he just send requests and they sent him</text><text start="3533.08" dur="6.96">back and then he like did a like</text><text start="3536.62" dur="5.34">clustering analysis on where parking</text><text start="3540.04" dur="4.8">tickets were most likely given in San</text><text start="3541.96" dur="4.65">Francisco he wanted to find out if there</text><text start="3544.84" dur="4.26">was a place to park that he can avoid</text><text start="3546.61" dur="5.4">ticket to like some pattern like if he</text><text start="3549.1" dur="4.35">could park there on Tuesday Wednesday he</text><text start="3552.01" dur="4.23">didn&amp;#39;t find anything I mean that and</text><text start="3553.45" dur="4.41">that&amp;#39;s one of the that&amp;#39;s one of things a</text><text start="3556.24" dur="3.24">lot of people don&amp;#39;t realize with the</text><text start="3557.86" dur="3.81">data Sciences sometimes you actually</text><text start="3559.48" dur="4.44">don&amp;#39;t discover anything or you just</text><text start="3561.67" dur="4.23">disprove hypothesis or there&amp;#39;s nothing</text><text start="3563.92" dur="4.29">to discover right there&amp;#39;s no answer to</text><text start="3565.9" dur="4.76">your question and so that was that was</text><text start="3568.21" dur="6.39">kind of this resolution to his project</text><text start="3570.66" dur="7.18">there was no there was nowhere to park</text><text start="3574.6" dur="5.64">in San Francisco oh you&amp;#39;re safe well oh</text><text start="3577.84" dur="4.92">where should be public like I think this</text><text start="3580.24" dur="5.19">is gonna depend on your domain I would</text><text start="3582.76" dur="5.55">say that for developers</text><text start="3585.43" dur="4.68">so really software people dev to is a</text><text start="3588.31" dur="3.06">really really great source I know like</text><text start="3590.11" dur="5.04">I&amp;#39;m biased because I used to work for</text><text start="3591.37" dur="5.85">them but dev 2 is really great um I also</text><text start="3595.15" dur="4.71">think that there&amp;#39;s a lot of validity and</text><text start="3597.22" dur="5.7">owning your platform so having a place</text><text start="3599.86" dur="6.18">where you publish your own blog post so</text><text start="3602.92" dur="4.65">a portfolio site or spending up a</text><text start="3606.04" dur="3.45">wordpress site or something along those</text><text start="3607.57" dur="7.02">lines and you totally have ownership of</text><text start="3609.49" dur="7.32">your content um medium is also another</text><text start="3614.59" dur="4.53">place I&amp;#39;m not sure if it&amp;#39;s still the</text><text start="3616.81" dur="3.84">place to go for data scientists but</text><text start="3619.12" dur="3.99">there was a lot of issues with it with</text><text start="3620.65" dur="3.81">like web developers and so I think most</text><text start="3623.11" dur="5.69">of them kind of moved off of it but</text><text start="3624.46" dur="4.34">medium was a really big platform as well</text><text start="3629.59" dur="4.71">I would take one last question looks</text><text start="3632.62" dur="4.08">like we got one more from Karen and then</text><text start="3634.3" dur="4.41">we&amp;#39;ll wrap up well about asking</text><text start="3636.7" dur="4.86">questions at the end of interview was an</text><text start="3638.71" dur="4.8">important one to gauge their interest</text><text start="3641.56" dur="6.77">and if they would you would fit in the</text><text start="3643.51" dur="8.01">country a company um I asked things like</text><text start="3648.33" dur="6.19">what the day-to-day for the job would</text><text start="3651.52" dur="5.81">look like so that you have an example of</text><text start="3654.52" dur="5.91">what is going to happen in that position</text><text start="3657.33" dur="5.74">um I also had some really good ones as</text><text start="3660.43" dur="5.97">well recently yeah I&amp;#39;m actually really</text><text start="3663.07" dur="6.93">good at asking questions it&amp;#39;s like one</text><text start="3666.4" dur="5.55">of my skill set I do like a couple of</text><text start="3670" dur="3.84">funny ones but one one I actually came</text><text start="3671.95" dur="4.14">up with recently is I&amp;#39;m actually very</text><text start="3673.84" dur="4.83">anti meeting culture like where you have</text><text start="3676.09" dur="5.13">a lot of meetings so sometimes I&amp;#39;ll ask</text><text start="3678.67" dur="3.84">or I&amp;#39;ve thought to ask like oh how often</text><text start="3681.22" dur="3.24">do you have meetings or why do you have</text><text start="3682.51" dur="4.95">meetings when you work on projects to</text><text start="3684.46" dur="4.41">see if people have regularly scheduled</text><text start="3687.46" dur="3.71">meetings or if it&amp;#39;s like more ad hoc</text><text start="3688.87" dur="6.42">which is kind of what I like and then</text><text start="3691.17" dur="6.97">one that I asked I used to ask a lot is</text><text start="3695.29" dur="3.69">if you were CEO for a day like what</text><text start="3698.14" dur="3.81">would you change</text><text start="3698.98" dur="4.95">oh that&amp;#39;s awesome that&amp;#39;s yeah and so</text><text start="3701.95" dur="4.11">really you really give some insight into</text><text start="3703.93" dur="3.33">people into like what they don&amp;#39;t like</text><text start="3706.06" dur="2.58">about their company right because if</text><text start="3707.26" dur="5.07">they could only change one thing if they</text><text start="3708.64" dur="5.55">were the boss yeah a lot of people&amp;#39;s</text><text start="3712.33" dur="8.76">like like more like free cold brew I</text><text start="3714.19" dur="7.66">think you were saying it yeah yeah I</text><text start="3721.09" dur="3.34">think</text><text start="3721.85" dur="6">at the end of the day a question that</text><text start="3724.43" dur="4.68">shows there&amp;#39;s a couple there&amp;#39;s a couple</text><text start="3727.85" dur="2.52">strategies right a question that shows</text><text start="3729.11" dur="3.3">you&amp;#39;ve done research about the company</text><text start="3730.37" dur="3.66">like you could have something about a</text><text start="3732.41" dur="4.32">large project or initiative that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="3734.03" dur="4.56">become public and you could kind of ask</text><text start="3736.73" dur="4.59">details about that and to show your</text><text start="3738.59" dur="4.2">interest in the space you could talk to</text><text start="3741.32" dur="3.24">about trends in the industry like what</text><text start="3742.79" dur="3.09">someone thinks about like an upcoming</text><text start="3744.56" dur="2.85">trend for example if you are</text><text start="3745.88" dur="3.96">interviewing at GA you could talk about</text><text start="3747.41" dur="5.88">like ISAs which are a type of financing</text><text start="3749.84" dur="7.77">or like remote learning or
