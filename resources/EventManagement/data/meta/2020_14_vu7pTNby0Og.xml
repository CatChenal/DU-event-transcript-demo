to say um</text><text start="256.88" dur="4.879">so today i&amp;#39;m going to be talking about</text><text start="259.04" dur="3.84">three lessons from three years of data</text><text start="261.759" dur="2.481">science so</text><text start="262.88" dur="5.84">going over what are some of the big</text><text start="264.24" dur="8.16">things i&amp;#39;ve learned so far in my career</text><text start="268.72" dur="4.56">so a little bit about me so my day today</text><text start="272.4" dur="3.519">i&amp;#39;m currently</text><text start="273.28" dur="3.28">a data scientist working in industry and</text><text start="275.919" dur="2.481">i&amp;#39;ve been</text><text start="276.56" dur="4.56">working with companies and consulting of</text><text start="278.4" dur="5.04">various sizes for about three years</text><text start="281.12" dur="4.4">i want to give a quick shout out to the</text><text start="283.44" dur="2.88">legal company of my current employer and</text><text start="285.52" dur="3.52">just</text><text start="286.32" dur="4.8">clarify that what i&amp;#39;m presenting today</text><text start="289.04" dur="3.2">are my own views do not represent the</text><text start="291.12" dur="4.32">views of my</text><text start="292.24" dur="5.04">employer at all</text><text start="295.44" dur="3.92">and another thing that i&amp;#39;m currently</text><text start="297.28" dur="4.16">working on is i&amp;#39;m</text><text start="299.36" dur="3.6">working on a book on data science</text><text start="301.44" dur="3.52">communication called mastering</text><text start="302.96" dur="5.28">communication and data science</text><text start="304.96" dur="7.36">um which will be hopefully out late of</text><text start="308.24" dur="6.56">2021 if all the deadlines are met um</text><text start="312.32" dur="4.159">and then in terms of my background so i</text><text start="314.8" dur="4.72">do have a masters of</text><text start="316.479" dur="4">statistical science and when i was in</text><text start="319.52" dur="3.92">grad school i</text><text start="320.479" dur="3.841">focused particularly on the areas of</text><text start="323.44" dur="3.039">beijing</text><text start="324.32" dur="4.08">statistics machine learning as well as</text><text start="326.479" dur="5.121">python and r programming</text><text start="328.4" dur="6">but say definitely more of my day-to-day</text><text start="331.6" dur="4.72">is spent in python and that is my</text><text start="334.4" dur="2.16">language of choice but i&amp;#39;ve also dabbled</text><text start="336.32" dur="4">in</text><text start="336.56" dur="5.44">r and i also have a background in sports</text><text start="340.32" dur="3.76">analytics</text><text start="342" dur="3.039">i interned for an mba team when i was in</text><text start="344.08" dur="4.64">school</text><text start="345.039" dur="5.521">and actually my love of sports and being</text><text start="348.72" dur="3.28">able to combine that with statistics</text><text start="350.56" dur="4.8">through sports analytics is</text><text start="352" dur="4.96">what really got me interested in</text><text start="355.36" dur="3.6">learning more about statistics and</text><text start="356.96" dur="2.48">eventually becoming a data scientist</text><text start="358.96" dur="3.04">like i</text><text start="359.44" dur="2.56">am today</text><text start="363.84" dur="4.16">so a quick overview of what this</text><text start="366.72" dur="4.479">presentation is going to</text><text start="368" dur="4.72">look like so these three areas project</text><text start="371.199" dur="2.801">management communication and</text><text start="372.72" dur="3.12">self-promotion</text><text start="374" dur="4.08">these are the three big areas that the</text><text start="375.84" dur="5.199">lessons i&amp;#39;m going to talk about today</text><text start="378.08" dur="4">fall into and these are definitely three</text><text start="381.039" dur="3.28">things that have been</text><text start="382.08" dur="4.32">pretty impactful to me and have helped</text><text start="384.319" dur="5.761">my career up to this point</text><text start="386.4" dur="5.76">and i do get a lot of requests for</text><text start="390.08" dur="4.32">students just asking questions about</text><text start="392.16" dur="4.479">data science and they often ask</text><text start="394.4" dur="3.919">you know what do i wish i had known back</text><text start="396.639" dur="3.201">when i was starting my career or when i</text><text start="398.319" dur="4.16">was applying to jobs</text><text start="399.84" dur="4.079">and these three things here are usually</text><text start="402.479" dur="3.361">make up the bulk of</text><text start="403.919" dur="3.12">the answers that i&amp;#39;ll give to that so</text><text start="405.84" dur="3.44">i&amp;#39;m going to cover</text><text start="407.039" dur="4.56">what each of these three lessons are as</text><text start="409.28" dur="4.479">well as some ways that they show up</text><text start="411.599" dur="5.281">now in my day-to-day or how i go about</text><text start="413.759" dur="3.121">using these lessons</text><text start="419.28" dur="3.84">so first in the area of project</text><text start="421.84" dur="3.199">management</text><text start="423.12" dur="3.6">one big thing that was especially really</text><text start="425.039" dur="4.641">different from school that i learned</text><text start="426.72" dur="4.4">is that the most accurate model is not</text><text start="429.68" dur="5.04">necessarily</text><text start="431.12" dur="5.76">always the best model so</text><text start="434.72" dur="4.4">with project management i&amp;#39;ve definitely</text><text start="436.88" dur="3.52">also learned a lot about working with</text><text start="439.12" dur="4.079">people who aren&amp;#39;t</text><text start="440.4" dur="4.799">data scientists i could probably say a</text><text start="443.199" dur="2.801">lot of lessons in this area but i think</text><text start="445.199" dur="2.641">this one</text><text start="446" dur="3.12">summarizes a lot of what i&amp;#39;ve learned</text><text start="447.84" dur="3.12">the most</text><text start="449.12" dur="3.68">you know in school you seem to always be</text><text start="450.96" dur="4.56">trying to fit that best model</text><text start="452.8" dur="4.72">in terms of some sort of predictive</text><text start="455.52" dur="4.079">accuracy whether it was</text><text start="457.52" dur="3.76">mean squared error area under the curve</text><text start="459.599" dur="2.241">or whatever metric you were looking at</text><text start="461.28" dur="2.88">and</text><text start="461.84" dur="3.919">i can distinctly remember being in like</text><text start="464.16" dur="2.719">the bowels of the basement the night</text><text start="465.759" dur="3.601">before</text><text start="466.879" dur="4.401">that project was due adding variables</text><text start="469.36" dur="2.88">looking for additional data trying to</text><text start="471.28" dur="4.639">improve</text><text start="472.24" dur="5.679">that performance and</text><text start="475.919" dur="3.68">this is not necessarily now how i</text><text start="477.919" dur="6.241">approach these projects</text><text start="479.599" dur="5.921">and in terms of why</text><text start="484.16" dur="3.28">it&amp;#39;s important to know that the most</text><text start="485.52" dur="2.72">accurate model is not always the best</text><text start="487.44" dur="2.8">model</text><text start="488.24" dur="3.44">is there are lots of different things</text><text start="490.24" dur="4">that you need to consider when you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="491.68" dur="5.68">developing a model for a project</text><text start="494.24" dur="5.76">it&amp;#39;s very rare for you to be working</text><text start="497.36" dur="4.32">in a data science vacuum like maybe when</text><text start="500" dur="3.68">you&amp;#39;re doing school projects</text><text start="501.68" dur="3.68">it was kind of just yourself and your</text><text start="503.68" dur="4.079">group working on something</text><text start="505.36" dur="4.239">but now in my day to day it&amp;#39;s very</text><text start="507.759" dur="4">typical for me to be interacting with a</text><text start="509.599" dur="4.081">marketing team or a product team or a</text><text start="511.759" dur="5.041">strategy or leadership</text><text start="513.68" dur="5.52">and first of all you need to be able to</text><text start="516.8" dur="5.2">operate within constraints of deadlines</text><text start="519.2" dur="3.839">so sometimes i&amp;#39;ll get requests come in</text><text start="522" dur="2.8">that have</text><text start="523.039" dur="3.121">like they need an answer by the next day</text><text start="524.8" dur="3.92">or within the week</text><text start="526.16" dur="3.84">i do also get some more long-term asks</text><text start="528.72" dur="4.64">but</text><text start="530" dur="6.8">you&amp;#39;ll need to also be cognizant of</text><text start="533.36" dur="6.08">how how much time that you have to turn</text><text start="536.8" dur="4.56">this around</text><text start="539.44" dur="3.28">and obviously fitting a really</text><text start="541.36" dur="3.039">complicated model</text><text start="542.72" dur="3.28">takes a lot more time than maybe doing</text><text start="544.399" dur="5.361">something a little bit more basic</text><text start="546" dur="6">or that requires less computing time or</text><text start="549.76" dur="5.6">something</text><text start="552" dur="5.44">it&amp;#39;s also important to note that complex</text><text start="555.36" dur="3.28">as you build more complex models this</text><text start="557.44" dur="3.28">can lead to increased</text><text start="558.64" dur="4.08">costs and something that i didn&amp;#39;t have</text><text start="560.72" dur="3.52">to deal with as much before i started</text><text start="562.72" dur="4.239">working in a company</text><text start="564.24" dur="3.68">was the fact that my team now has a</text><text start="566.959" dur="4.481">budget</text><text start="567.92" dur="5.52">so it could be great that i want to fit</text><text start="571.44" dur="4.399">you know maybe some really complex</text><text start="573.44" dur="3.6">artificial intelligence neural network</text><text start="575.839" dur="2.881">type model</text><text start="577.04" dur="4.479">but at the end of the day you might only</text><text start="578.72" dur="5.84">see a marginal increase in that accuracy</text><text start="581.519" dur="4.32">so you have to think about not only the</text><text start="584.56" dur="4.399">time that it takes</text><text start="585.839" dur="5.12">to build that more complicated model</text><text start="588.959" dur="3.681">even if you do see maybe an increase in</text><text start="590.959" dur="4.721">that accuracy</text><text start="592.64" dur="5.759">but as they say like to be cliche</text><text start="595.68" dur="4.64">time is money so if i&amp;#39;m spending a lot</text><text start="598.399" dur="2.481">of my time that&amp;#39;s only going to yield a</text><text start="600.32" dur="2.88">really</text><text start="600.88" dur="3.36">marginal return in that increased</text><text start="603.2" dur="2.96">accuracy</text><text start="604.24" dur="3.36">that takes away from my other priorities</text><text start="606.16" dur="4.239">that i&amp;#39;m working on</text><text start="607.6" dur="4.64">um and more complex models can also just</text><text start="610.399" dur="5.361">be more expensive from</text><text start="612.24" dur="8">a computing resource stand standpoint</text><text start="615.76" dur="7.36">as well and then sort of the last</text><text start="620.24" dur="4.88">reason behind this lesson is that when</text><text start="623.12" dur="3.839">you&amp;#39;re doing black box models or ones</text><text start="625.12" dur="4.159">that are more complicated those can also</text><text start="626.959" dur="5.041">be really difficult to explain</text><text start="629.279" dur="3.281">so this is something that is special to</text><text start="632" dur="2.16">note</text><text start="632.56" dur="3.68">especially if you&amp;#39;re working with</text><text start="634.16" dur="2.4">stakeholders who might be less familiar</text><text start="636.24" dur="2.8">with</text><text start="636.56" dur="3.6">data science is that at the end of the</text><text start="639.04" dur="3.28">day</text><text start="640.16" dur="3.6">you do need to provide some explanation</text><text start="642.32" dur="3.36">of how you got to the numbers that</text><text start="643.76" dur="5.12">you&amp;#39;re delivering or</text><text start="645.68" dur="5.599">the recommendations that you&amp;#39;re making</text><text start="648.88" dur="4.72">and it&amp;#39;s a lot more complicated to</text><text start="651.279" dur="6">explain some</text><text start="653.6" dur="5.04">like big ai model versus something that</text><text start="657.279" dur="4.401">might be a little bit more simpler but</text><text start="658.64" dur="5.04">does the job almost as well</text><text start="661.68" dur="3.36">and you definitely want to make sure</text><text start="663.68" dur="3.04">that you can explain these things so</text><text start="665.04" dur="5.28">that you can build</text><text start="666.72" dur="4.88">trust within those teams but that i&amp;#39;ll</text><text start="670.32" dur="3.44">touch on a little bit</text><text start="671.6" dur="5.359">more later when we get to the</text><text start="673.76" dur="3.199">communication section</text><text start="678.399" dur="4.961">so how i go about like really taking</text><text start="681.2" dur="6.4">this lesson in my day-to-day</text><text start="683.36" dur="6.32">so first of all is whenever i start</text><text start="687.6" dur="3.12">a project i tend to approach it in the</text><text start="689.68" dur="3.279">same way</text><text start="690.72" dur="4.559">and that is by starting simple and just</text><text start="692.959" dur="3.921">evaluating as i go</text><text start="695.279" dur="4.401">so the first thing that&amp;#39;s really</text><text start="696.88" dur="4.959">important to do is just figure out</text><text start="699.68" dur="3.92">what has been done before and this can</text><text start="701.839" dur="3.761">be something that&amp;#39;s either</text><text start="703.6" dur="3.04">internally or externally within your</text><text start="705.6" dur="4.56">company</text><text start="706.64" dur="5.28">so i&amp;#39;ll usually try to see either within</text><text start="710.16" dur="2.72">my own team or if there&amp;#39;s some other</text><text start="711.92" dur="3.68">data science</text><text start="712.88" dur="3.12">teams that work closely with us like</text><text start="715.6" dur="2.239">have they</text><text start="716" dur="4.88">built a model or some sort of report</text><text start="717.839" dur="5.521">that i might be able to capitalize on</text><text start="720.88" dur="3.68">and see what i can reuse and then</text><text start="723.36" dur="3.36">externally</text><text start="724.56" dur="4.32">we&amp;#39;ll usually do some searches for</text><text start="726.72" dur="3.44">either white papers or some other</text><text start="728.88" dur="4.639">company data science</text><text start="730.16" dur="4.88">blogs where i can see</text><text start="733.519" dur="3.681">what they&amp;#39;ve applied in a similar</text><text start="735.04" dur="3.76">situation see if i can borrow anything</text><text start="737.2" dur="4.24">from that or adapt it for my own</text><text start="738.8" dur="2.64">situation</text><text start="742" dur="4.48">it&amp;#39;s the next thing i&amp;#39;ll do is then</text><text start="744.399" dur="3.761">figure out how to establish what i call</text><text start="746.48" dur="4.64">a baseline level</text><text start="748.16" dur="4.72">so say this is a modeling project in</text><text start="751.12" dur="3.2">that case i would start out by creating</text><text start="752.88" dur="3.92">a really simple model</text><text start="754.32" dur="4.48">and look at however i want to evaluate</text><text start="756.8" dur="2.8">that so maybe it&amp;#39;s the mean squared</text><text start="758.8" dur="2.8">error</text><text start="759.6" dur="3.919">and this is really important because</text><text start="761.6" dur="4.88">then you have a score to beat</text><text start="763.519" dur="4.721">that as you try to maybe add more</text><text start="766.48" dur="4.88">variables to this model or just</text><text start="768.24" dur="4.24">look at other analysis options you have</text><text start="771.36" dur="4">something that you can</text><text start="772.48" dur="3.2">compare it with so in if you were to</text><text start="775.36" dur="2.08">just</text><text start="775.68" dur="4.48">jump right in and try to make something</text><text start="777.44" dur="3.76">really complex you throw a lot of time</text><text start="780.16" dur="2.479">into that</text><text start="781.2" dur="3.04">and at the end of the day it could be</text><text start="782.639" dur="3.361">the simplest thing that took</text><text start="784.24" dur="4">not as much time was actually your best</text><text start="786" dur="4">solution so it&amp;#39;s really important that</text><text start="788.24" dur="5.92">you just get a sense of</text><text start="790" dur="6.399">okay what would be that simplest answer</text><text start="794.16" dur="5.679">and what sort of evaluation can i look</text><text start="796.399" dur="5.921">at to see if i beat it</text><text start="799.839" dur="4.161">then as i&amp;#39;m going throughout this</text><text start="802.32" dur="5.199">project i&amp;#39;m always looking</text><text start="804" dur="6.56">at that difference in performance so</text><text start="807.519" dur="4.641">for me personally um for my projects i&amp;#39;m</text><text start="810.56" dur="3.04">typically working with hundreds of</text><text start="812.16" dur="5.2">millions if not billions of</text><text start="813.6" dur="5.52">observation points so i&amp;#39;ll typically fit</text><text start="817.36" dur="3.919">a model on like a smaller</text><text start="819.12" dur="3.6">data set look at the performance and see</text><text start="821.279" dur="3.521">if that will scale</text><text start="822.72" dur="4.4">so what i mean by look at that</text><text start="824.8" dur="5.039">performance difference is one</text><text start="827.12" dur="3.44">a more complex model that&amp;#39;s going to</text><text start="829.839" dur="3.041">require</text><text start="830.56" dur="4.399">more time and more money to fit does it</text><text start="832.88" dur="4.8">perform better</text><text start="834.959" dur="4.56">and if the answer is yes does that</text><text start="837.68" dur="3.279">difference in performance justify the</text><text start="839.519" dur="2.961">amount of time and money that it would</text><text start="840.959" dur="3.12">take to scale it</text><text start="842.48" dur="3.359">and this is definitely a trade-off where</text><text start="844.079" dur="4.961">you need to think through</text><text start="845.839" dur="4.081">the pros and cons and it&amp;#39;s something</text><text start="849.04" dur="2.72">that i think</text><text start="849.92" dur="4">you&amp;#39;ll get a better sense of to when</text><text start="851.76" dur="4.079">you&amp;#39;re working on projects and</text><text start="853.92" dur="4.159">collaborating with other teams to figure</text><text start="855.839" dur="4">out okay in what case</text><text start="858.079" dur="3.76">is it okay that we&amp;#39;re going to lose you</text><text start="859.839" dur="5.68">know like a 0.25</text><text start="861.839" dur="3.68">difference versus something bigger</text><text start="868.079" dur="3.841">so the other big thing that i&amp;#39;ve learned</text><text start="871.199" dur="3.121">that</text><text start="871.92" dur="3.359">sort of falls into this area but i</text><text start="874.32" dur="2.639">wanted to</text><text start="875.279" dur="3.601">definitely have a call out for it</text><text start="876.959" dur="3.761">because this is an area that i</text><text start="878.88" dur="3.36">personally have learned so much out of</text><text start="880.72" dur="3.679">side of school in</text><text start="882.24" dur="3.039">is learning how to manage computing</text><text start="884.399" dur="2.961">costs</text><text start="885.279" dur="3.36">so when i introduced this lesson i said</text><text start="887.36" dur="3.12">that</text><text start="888.639" dur="4.081">oftentimes like teams are operating</text><text start="890.48" dur="4.64">under budgets now and as you make things</text><text start="892.72" dur="5.359">more and more complicated it requires</text><text start="895.12" dur="3.44">more time and more computing power to to</text><text start="898.079" dur="3.681">fit</text><text start="898.56" dur="5.68">and finish that analysis but</text><text start="901.76" dur="3.84">here are some things that i&amp;#39;ve learned</text><text start="904.24" dur="3.039">that are helpful in</text><text start="905.6" dur="3.919">kind of learning how to manage those</text><text start="907.279" dur="4.321">costs so</text><text start="909.519" dur="3.68">first of all is just learning</text><text start="911.6" dur="5.359">differences between</text><text start="913.199" dur="6.32">cluster settings so when i say</text><text start="916.959" dur="4.641">clusters i&amp;#39;m referring to basically like</text><text start="919.519" dur="5.041">these super computers that</text><text start="921.6" dur="4.4">i can access from my personal laptop by</text><text start="924.56" dur="4.959">logging into them and writing</text><text start="926" dur="6.32">code and sending it to them so</text><text start="929.519" dur="4.32">like google cloud computing resources if</text><text start="932.32" dur="2.8">you&amp;#39;ve worked with that you&amp;#39;ll use</text><text start="933.839" dur="4.8">clusters in that</text><text start="935.12" dur="5.6">also aws or amazon web services</text><text start="938.639" dur="4">they also have these like super</text><text start="940.72" dur="4.4">computers that you can use</text><text start="942.639" dur="4.64">and i&amp;#39;ll admit too this is something</text><text start="945.12" dur="4.88">that i&amp;#39;m still definitely learning from</text><text start="947.279" dur="3.68">like in my day to day but just really</text><text start="950" dur="3.199">understanding</text><text start="950.959" dur="4.641">the differences between the certain</text><text start="953.199" dur="4.08">types of processing units that can</text><text start="955.6" dur="3.44">you can have in a cluster as well as</text><text start="957.279" dur="2.641">what does it actually mean to give it</text><text start="959.04" dur="2.32">more</text><text start="959.92" dur="3.919">memory and what sort of things are</text><text start="961.36" dur="4">stored in memory there&amp;#39;s a lot of stuff</text><text start="963.839" dur="3.12">out there</text><text start="965.36" dur="4.08">a lot of times the companies that you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="966.959" dur="4">using for these resources will post</text><text start="969.44" dur="3.92">have a library of documents or</text><text start="970.959" dur="4.24">information about it that can be helpful</text><text start="973.36" dur="3.12">i also know some of the ones i&amp;#39;ve worked</text><text start="975.199" dur="3.841">with they</text><text start="976.48" dur="4.08">provide like an office hours or have</text><text start="979.04" dur="4.159">people you can reach out to to ask</text><text start="980.56" dur="3.199">questions i&amp;#39;d say that&amp;#39;s definitely a</text><text start="983.199" dur="3.521">great</text><text start="983.759" dur="3.841">source but again like this is something</text><text start="986.72" dur="4.08">i&amp;#39;m definitely</text><text start="987.6" dur="5.679">still learning as well um so</text><text start="990.8" dur="4.08">i recognize that it seems very easy when</text><text start="993.279" dur="2.721">i say learn the differences but in</text><text start="994.88" dur="4.399">reality it&amp;#39;s not</text><text start="996" dur="4.32">always that simple and then the other</text><text start="999.279" dur="3.36">thing</text><text start="1000.32" dur="3.12">in terms of managing computing costs is</text><text start="1002.639" dur="2.961">thinking about</text><text start="1003.44" dur="3.12">ways that you can reduce the size of the</text><text start="1005.6" dur="4.08">data</text><text start="1006.56" dur="5.839">so say for example that we fit</text><text start="1009.68" dur="3.68">on a hundred percent of our training set</text><text start="1012.399" dur="3.44">but</text><text start="1013.36" dur="4">if we fit on 75 percent of our training</text><text start="1015.839" dur="3.36">set it would take</text><text start="1017.36" dur="3.76">less time and there&amp;#39;s only a small</text><text start="1019.199" dur="4">reduction in accuracy</text><text start="1021.12" dur="4.079">so just thinking through like all these</text><text start="1023.199" dur="3.681">different ways of can i actually reduce</text><text start="1025.199" dur="3.12">the size of the data that i&amp;#39;m running</text><text start="1026.88" dur="5.039">through this model</text><text start="1028.319" dur="5.681">and still get comparable results</text><text start="1031.919" dur="3.841">can also think about do i actually need</text><text start="1034" dur="3.6">to be including all of these features in</text><text start="1035.76" dur="3.84">the model that i&amp;#39;m training</text><text start="1037.6" dur="3.68">maybe there&amp;#39;s some that are correlated</text><text start="1039.6" dur="2.4">enough that you can drop them or think</text><text start="1041.28" dur="3.919">about</text><text start="1042" dur="4.88">just getting down that size especially</text><text start="1045.199" dur="3.12">if you&amp;#39;re getting to a more complicated</text><text start="1046.88" dur="3.2">model</text><text start="1048.319" dur="3.761">and then i&amp;#39;ll say the last thing that</text><text start="1050.08" dur="5.12">i&amp;#39;ve definitely gotten better</text><text start="1052.08" dur="4.64">with is just using</text><text start="1055.2" dur="4">being able to take advantage of the</text><text start="1056.72" dur="6.56">efficiency of parallel computing</text><text start="1059.2" dur="6.719">so when i say parallel computing</text><text start="1063.28" dur="3.84">there are say i want to fit a bunch of</text><text start="1065.919" dur="3.201">smaller models</text><text start="1067.12" dur="3.2">and combine all of their powers to make</text><text start="1069.12" dur="4.24">a really</text><text start="1070.32" dur="4.96">complicated like bigger model</text><text start="1073.36" dur="3.679">i could use parallel computing in that</text><text start="1075.28" dur="3.6">sense that i could use a bunch of these</text><text start="1077.039" dur="4.721">different super computers</text><text start="1078.88" dur="4.799">send smaller models out to each of them</text><text start="1081.76" dur="3.6">and they&amp;#39;ll all run at the same time so</text><text start="1083.679" dur="4.88">that can reduce your time and your</text><text start="1085.36" dur="6.4">computational power as well</text><text start="1088.559" dur="5.12">so again these are just a few areas that</text><text start="1091.76" dur="4.72">maybe at the end of the day you find out</text><text start="1093.679" dur="4.641">that simple model like</text><text start="1096.48" dur="3.28">does okay but you really want to get to</text><text start="1098.32" dur="3.76">that complicated model</text><text start="1099.76" dur="5.2">these are some ways that you can go</text><text start="1102.08" dur="2.88">about doing that</text><text start="1105.12" dur="3.36">so before i get to the next lesson i&amp;#39;m</text><text start="1107.6" dur="4.24">just going to check</text><text start="1108.48" dur="7.12">the chat real quick to see if we have</text><text start="1111.84" dur="3.76">any questions come up</text><text start="1116.64" dur="4.88">you also there&amp;#39;ll be time at the end as</text><text start="1119.039" dur="5.201">well um</text><text start="1121.52" dur="3.279">but okay i don&amp;#39;t see any right now so</text><text start="1124.24" dur="4">we&amp;#39;ll</text><text start="1124.799" dur="6.481">move to</text><text start="1128.24" dur="5.679">communication so</text><text start="1131.28" dur="4.24">in the area of communication the big</text><text start="1133.919" dur="2.161">lesson here is that it&amp;#39;s really</text><text start="1135.52" dur="3.039">important</text><text start="1136.08" dur="4.4">to be able to explain your job to</text><text start="1138.559" dur="4.48">non-technical peers</text><text start="1140.48" dur="4.4">so when you&amp;#39;re in school you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="1143.039" dur="2.64">typically you know speaking the same</text><text start="1144.88" dur="3.12">language</text><text start="1145.679" dur="4">as your peers and your professors you</text><text start="1148" dur="3.76">can get up there and give a project</text><text start="1149.679" dur="5.641">presentation and just</text><text start="1151.76" dur="6.32">drop all of the jargon out there about</text><text start="1155.32" dur="3.239">parameterizations and loss functions and</text><text start="1158.08" dur="4.8">ai</text><text start="1158.559" dur="7.201">big data all of that stuff but</text><text start="1162.88" dur="4.4">when you&amp;#39;re working as a data scientist</text><text start="1165.76" dur="5.52">especially if you&amp;#39;re in like an</text><text start="1167.28" dur="6">industry role you&amp;#39;re going to be</text><text start="1171.28" dur="4.399">working with a bunch of teams who aren&amp;#39;t</text><text start="1173.28" dur="5.2">data scientists and who</text><text start="1175.679" dur="4.401">maybe have taken an intro stats course</text><text start="1178.48" dur="3.36">so</text><text start="1180.08" dur="3.44">they don&amp;#39;t necessarily need to know the</text><text start="1181.84" dur="1.92">in-depth details you&amp;#39;re not going to get</text><text start="1183.52" dur="2.88">up</text><text start="1183.76" dur="3.2">in a meeting and start writing greek</text><text start="1186.4" dur="3.279">symbols</text><text start="1186.96" dur="4.719">on the board but you do need to be able</text><text start="1189.679" dur="3.281">to explain some of these more complex</text><text start="1191.679" dur="2.88">things that you&amp;#39;re doing</text><text start="1192.96" dur="4.8">to an audience that doesn&amp;#39;t have that</text><text start="1194.559" dur="3.201">same background as you</text><text start="1198.48" dur="5.199">so why this is important i touched on</text><text start="1201.2" dur="5.92">this first point in the previous section</text><text start="1203.679" dur="5.521">but it&amp;#39;s really important that you build</text><text start="1207.12" dur="3.679">trust and develop a relationship with a</text><text start="1209.2" dur="2.32">lot of these teams that you&amp;#39;re working</text><text start="1210.799" dur="3.12">with</text><text start="1211.52" dur="4.08">this is especially important

dur="7.68">data science um</text><text start="1221.679" dur="4.081">and that&amp;#39;s because they need to</text><text start="1224.96" dur="3.76">understand</text><text start="1225.76" dur="4.48">more about like how you come about your</text><text start="1228.72" dur="2.48">numbers and such because you wouldn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="1230.24" dur="2.48">expect</text><text

dur="4.64">happen um</text><text start="1290.08" dur="5.36">so being able to explain like</text><text start="1293.12" dur="4.16">how complicated things work can really</text><text start="1295.44" dur="2.88">help you just educate the people that</text><text start="1297.28" dur="3.84">you&amp;#39;re working with</text><text start="1298.32" dur="4.16">on that process and make sure and

to</text><text start="1319.039" dur="4">a diverse group of audiences and this is</text><text start="1321.84" dur="2.959">something that will be</text><text start="1323.039" dur="3.921">important within your own company in</text><text start="1324.799" dur="5.041">your own role but also outside</text><text start="1326.96" dur="5.44">because my previous two points you don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="1329.84" dur="3.28">want data science to be seen as the team</text><text start="1332.4" dur="2.56">that just</text><text start="1333.12" dur="3.84">sits off in the corner and writes all of</text><text start="1334.96" dur="3.76">their code and does math and then comes</text><text start="1336.96" dur="3.52">out with some numbers</text><text start="1338.72" dur="3.12">you want you do you want people to</text><text start="1340.48" dur="4">recognize you as an</text><text start="1341.84" dur="3.12">expert in terms of how they can get the</text><text start="1344.48" dur="2">most</text><text start="1344.96" dur="3.599">information out of their data how it can</text><text start="1346.48" dur="4.48">help them inform their strategy</text><text start="1348.559" dur="4.321">but you are also relying on the</text><text start="1350.96" dur="3.36">expertise of the other teams that you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="1352.88" dur="4">working with as well</text><text start="1354.32" dur="5.12">and you want them to help inform you</text><text start="1356.88" dur="4.56">throughout that partnership</text><text start="1359.44" dur="3.68">and then in terms of outside of your</text><text start="1361.44" dur="4.32">company um</text><text start="1363.12" dur="4.4">if you&amp;#39;re interested in like going to</text><text start="1365.76" dur="2.08">conferences and talking about your work</text><text start="1367.52" dur="2.72">or</text><text start="1367.84" dur="4.719">writing blog posts or having a presence</text><text start="1370.24" dur="4.48">like that that can help your career</text><text start="1372.559" dur="4.48">it&amp;#39;s really important to have these</text><text start="1374.72" dur="5.36">communication skills as well</text><text start="1377.039" dur="6.481">and you can maybe even get some new</text><text start="1380.08" dur="3.44">opportunities out of them</text><text start="1386.159" dur="3.281">so what are some of the ways that i go</text><text start="1388.64" dur="3.519">about</text><text start="1389.44" dur="4">um using this communication lesson and</text><text start="1392.159" dur="4.241">applying it</text><text start="1393.44" dur="3.92">so this is really a topic that i could</text><text start="1396.4" dur="4.8">talk about</text><text start="1397.36" dur="5.6">forever but i&amp;#39;ll give like a very</text><text start="1401.2" dur="3.68">kind of high level of how i think about</text><text start="1402.96" dur="4.88">some of this stuff and definitely</text><text start="1404.88" dur="4.4">if you have questions about it like</text><text start="1407.84" dur="3.28">throw them in the chat or</text><text start="1409.28" dur="3.04">you can also reach out to me after if</text><text start="1411.12" dur="2.48">you have something else you want to talk</text><text start="1412.32" dur="4.08">about more</text><text start="1413.6" dur="4">but i always think about when i&amp;#39;m</text><text start="1416.4" dur="2.399">presenting something that&amp;#39;s more</text><text start="1417.6" dur="2.88">complicated first</text><text start="1418.799" dur="4.641">thinking about how can i break this</text><text start="1420.48" dur="6.72">topic down into smaller chunks</text><text start="1423.44" dur="6.96">so suppose we have a situation where</text><text start="1427.2" dur="6.88">i have fit a decision tree model</text><text start="1430.4" dur="6">to help a marketing team predict if</text><text start="1434.08" dur="4.56">someone&amp;#39;s going to click on an ad</text><text start="1436.4" dur="4.48">so i would think about the different</text><text start="1438.64" dur="4.399">parts of a decision tree</text><text start="1440.88" dur="4">individually and then think about how i</text><text start="1443.039" dur="6.561">can present them all together</text><text start="1444.88" dur="7.919">so the great thing about a decision tree</text><text start="1449.6" dur="5.199">is it&amp;#39;s basically just a flow chart</text><text start="1452.799" dur="3.281">that we&amp;#39;re figuring out the structure of</text><text start="1454.799" dur="2.801">using math</text><text start="1456.08" dur="3.28">and a lot of times if you&amp;#39;re working</text><text start="1457.6" dur="2.64">with people of more of a business</text><text start="1459.36" dur="3.439">background</text><text start="1460.24" dur="3.36">like they&amp;#39;ve definitely seen a flow</text><text start="1462.799" dur="2.721">chart</text><text start="1463.6" dur="3.84">so in this case it&amp;#39;s really great to</text><text start="1465.52" dur="3.84">have like that example that they&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="1467.44" dur="5.119">probably seen like this</text><text start="1469.36" dur="6.799">image before um</text><text start="1472.559" dur="5.681">and to that second point it&amp;#39;s a decision</text><text start="1476.159" dur="4.321">tree at its essence is grouping together</text><text start="1478.24" dur="3.6">the most similar observations</text><text start="1480.48" dur="3.36">so we know that at the top of this</text><text start="1481.84" dur="4.24">flowchart we have all of</text><text start="1483.84" dur="4.16">in this case our customers of interest</text><text start="1486.08" dur="4">and we&amp;#39;re putting them into groups</text><text start="1488" dur="3.12">based on who&amp;#39;s most similar at that</text><text start="1490.08" dur="4.88">point</text><text start="1491.12" dur="5.28">and then lastly it&amp;#39;s always important to</text><text start="1494.96" dur="3.12">just think through what are some of the</text><text start="1496.4" dur="3.92">assumptions and limitations of a</text><text start="1498.08" dur="3.839">particular model that or analysis that</text><text start="1500.32" dur="4.719">you&amp;#39;re presenting</text><text start="1501.919" dur="5.36">so like for example in the case of the</text><text start="1505.039" dur="3.361">just with any model you can always talk</text><text start="1507.279" dur="4.321">about the risk of over</text><text start="1508.4" dur="6.32">fitting so if i</text><text start="1511.6" dur="5.6">have some data where the age</text><text start="1514.72" dur="5.04">range of the customers are maybe only</text><text start="1517.2" dur="4.959">between 18 and 35</text><text start="1519.76" dur="4">that model is not really going to apply</text><text start="1522.159" dur="3.041">well to someone outside of that age</text><text start="1523.76" dur="3.12">range for example</text><text start="1525.2" dur="3.68">and it&amp;#39;s just important to be</text><text start="1526.88" dur="4.08">responsible about sharing any</text><text start="1528.88" dur="4.159">assumptions and limitations</text><text start="1530.96" dur="4.319">just because at the end of the day if</text><text start="1533.039" dur="3.681">they you know take this analysis or take</text><text start="1535.279" dur="4.161">these numbers from your</text><text start="1536.72" dur="5.28">presentation and apply it elsewhere they</text><text start="1539.44" dur="4">just need to understand</text><text start="1542" dur="3.279">you don&amp;#39;t want you don&amp;#39;t want people to</text><text start="1543.44" dur="3.599">basically take your analysis and kind of</text><text start="1545.279" dur="3.201">run off with it and start applying it to</text><text start="1547.039" dur="3.201">a bunch of different areas that they</text><text start="1548.48" dur="2.88">shouldn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="1550.24" dur="6.799">and you just want to make sure that</text><text start="1551.36" dur="8.88">you&amp;#39;re getting that stuff across as well</text><text start="1557.039" dur="4.561">so the other way i think about um</text><text start="1560.24" dur="4.08">being able to communicate more</text><text start="1561.6" dur="3.92">effectively with the other teams that i</text><text start="1564.32" dur="4.08">work with</text><text start="1565.52" dur="3.519">is one to like walk through the model</text><text start="1568.4" dur="4.08">with the</text><text start="1569.039" dur="4.64">relatable and simple example so suppose</text><text start="1572.48" dur="3.6">this here</text><text start="1573.679" dur="3.441">shows like a very simple version of that</text><text start="1576.08" dur="2.959">decision tree</text><text start="1577.12" dur="4.32">for answering the question of okay will</text><text start="1579.039" dur="5.601">this customer click on the ad</text><text start="1581.44" dur="4.56">so i personally love putting visuals on</text><text start="1584.64" dur="2.88">size especially for this</text><text start="1586" dur="3.279">because it gives you something to point</text><text start="1587.52" dur="4.08">to you can</text><text start="1589.279" dur="4.321">um like really just lay things out</text><text start="1591.6" dur="3.84">clearly for people to see</text><text start="1593.6" dur="3.439">so say for example our simple and</text><text start="1595.44" dur="3.52">relatable example</text><text start="1597.039" dur="3.52">we&amp;#39;re just going to pick one person and</text><text start="1598.96" dur="2.319">see how does this model work in</text><text start="1600.559" dur="2">predicting</text><text start="1601.279" dur="3.201">are they going to click on this ad or</text><text start="1602.559" dur="4.961">not so up here</text><text start="1604.48" dur="4.799">in this top we have all of our people</text><text start="1607.52" dur="3.92">are all in one group these are all of</text><text start="1609.279" dur="4.561">our consumers who have been shown</text><text start="1611.44" dur="3.76">some sort of ad so say we want to</text><text start="1613.84" dur="3.839">predict for me</text><text start="1615.2" dur="3.76">am i going to click on that ad so we</text><text start="1617.679" dur="4.721">would go down to this</text><text start="1618.96" dur="6.079">age level and here you can remind them</text><text start="1622.4" dur="5.279">how those buckets are split up it&amp;#39;s how</text><text start="1625.039" dur="4.481">we&amp;#39;ve been able to quantitatively say</text><text start="1627.679" dur="4.081">these people are very similar to each</text><text start="1629.52" dur="4">other i&amp;#39;d say it&amp;#39;s pretty</text><text start="1631.76" dur="3.84">rare when you&amp;#39;re working with like a</text><text start="1633.52" dur="4.48">non-data science team that they would</text><text start="1635.6" dur="4.88">ask for the specifics in terms of</text><text start="1638" dur="3.12">like what function did you use to define</text><text start="1640.48" dur="3.04">that</text><text start="1641.12" dur="4.48">um so i wouldn&amp;#39;t worry so much about</text><text start="1643.52" dur="6">those details but just</text><text start="1645.6" dur="5.679">know okay the people who end up in this</text><text start="1649.52" dur="3.6">bucket together they&amp;#39;re all the most</text><text start="1651.279" dur="3.921">similar to each other at that level</text><text start="1653.12" dur="3.12">so for me i would go down to that 26</text><text start="1655.2" dur="4.56">plus group</text><text start="1656.24" dur="4.08">and then say okay either customers are</text><text start="1659.76" dur="3.519">shown an</text><text start="1660.32" dur="3.52">ad on instagram or one on facebook for</text><text start="1663.279" dur="2.4">me</text><text start="1663.84" dur="4.24">i was shown an ad on instagram so it</text><text start="1665.679" dur="5.521">would follow that flow chart down</text><text start="1668.08" dur="5.36">and we&amp;#39;d see within all the 26 plus year</text><text start="1671.2" dur="4.8">olds shown an ad on instagram</text><text start="1673.44" dur="4.08">only 34 of them clicked so we&amp;#39;re going</text><text start="1676" dur="5.679">to predict that i don&amp;#39;t click</text><text start="1677.52" dur="4.639">because the majority of people did not</text><text start="1681.679" dur="4">click</text><text start="1682.159" dur="6.161">in that instance and</text><text start="1685.679" dur="4.401">if you&amp;#39;re presenting to like say this</text><text start="1688.32" dur="2.8">was the marketing team or something else</text><text start="1690.08" dur="3.12">like definitely</text><text start="1691.12" dur="4">even if your actual analysis is a little</text><text start="1693.2" dur="3.28">bit more complicated really try to get</text><text start="1695.12" dur="3.679">it to</text><text start="1696.48" dur="4.4">a more simple example where you can just</text><text start="1698.799" dur="3.921">walk through each of these so</text><text start="1700.88" dur="3.6">i just walked through for example what</text><text start="1702.72" dur="2.64">this like a simple version of this</text><text start="1704.48" dur="4.16">decision tree</text><text start="1705.36" dur="4.319">looked like but maybe in reality i had</text><text start="1708.64" dur="2.96">more</text><text start="1709.679" dur="3.441">variables or more something but this at</text><text start="1711.6" dur="3.84">least gets them</text><text start="1713.12" dur="4.08">to the fundamental concepts of we&amp;#39;re</text><text start="1715.44" dur="3.359">really just grouping together people who</text><text start="1717.2" dur="3.76">are super similar</text><text start="1718.799" dur="3.6">and then we get to a point we&amp;#39;re just</text><text start="1720.96" dur="4.88">going to predict what the majority of</text><text start="1722.399" dur="3.441">those people said</text><text start="1731.12" dur="5.72">all right i&amp;#39;m not not seeing a question</text><text start="1735.2" dur="5.199">there</text><text start="1736.84" dur="6.6">um so then we can move on to</text><text start="1740.399" dur="5.64">the last uh the last</text><text start="1743.44" dur="4.32">area and lesson in regards of</text><text start="1746.039" dur="4.681">self-promotion</text><text start="1747.76" dur="4.24">so with this and this is definitely i</text><text start="1750.72" dur="3.76">think one of the things i&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="1752" dur="3.76">learned that has had the most impact on</text><text start="1754.48" dur="3.84">my career it&amp;#39;s also</text><text start="1755.76" dur="3.519">one of the most challenging things is to</text><text start="1758.32" dur="4.079">know that</text><text start="1759.279" dur="6.561">you are your own best advocate</text><text start="1762.399" dur="5.601">so for me i think i definitely got used</text><text start="1765.84" dur="4.48">to being in school and</text><text start="1768" dur="3.36">if you study hard really learn the</text><text start="1770.32" dur="4">material</text><text start="1771.36" dur="4.64">put together a good presentation that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="1774.32" dur="3.2">reflected in your grade so</text><text start="1776" dur="4.24">at the end of the day good work</text><text start="1777.52" dur="6.48">typically seems to be noticed but</text><text start="1780.24" dur="5.039">this isn&amp;#39;t necessarily always the case</text><text start="1784" dur="3.039">and this is something that can be</text><text start="1785.279" dur="3.041">especially challenging especially at a</text><text start="1787.039" dur="2.721">larger company</text><text start="1788.32" dur="4.56">and it&amp;#39;s not necessarily something</text><text start="1789.76" dur="5.919">that&amp;#39;s nefarious at all</text><text start="1792.88" dur="3.679">but when you&amp;#39;re working with a lot of</text><text start="1795.679" dur="2.561">other people there are a lot of</text><text start="1796.559" dur="2.48">different projects and priorities going</text><text start="1798.24" dur="4.08">on</text><text start="1799.039" dur="4.961">sometimes you just have to like raise</text><text start="1802.32" dur="4">your hand not literally but</text><text start="1804" dur="4.64">say hey look at me look at this really</text><text start="1806.32" dur="4.8">hard project i just finished and</text><text start="1808.64" dur="4.24">i definitely had to get used to</text><text start="1811.12" dur="3.039">promoting myself and talking about my</text><text start="1812.88" dur="3.519">own accomplishments</text><text start="1814.159" dur="3.841">because i found that i was constantly</text><text start="1816.399" dur="4.16">worried

but</text><text start="1823.679" dur="3.441">i feel like especially in my first three</text><text start="1826.48" dur="2.559">years and</text><text start="1827.12" dur="4.64">tending to be the more junior person in</text><text start="1829.039" dur="4.24">the room i also would doubt myself in</text><text start="1831.76" dur="4.32">terms of oh well</text><text start="1833.279" dur="4.64">sure i did finish this project but you</text><text start="1836.08" dur="4">know i&amp;#39;m sure someone who is a senior</text><text start="1837.919" dur="5.921">level could have done it so much more so</text><text start="1840.08" dur="3.76">or so much better um</text><text start="1844.159" dur="4.961">and in terms of why this is a really</text><text start="1848.32" dur="4.16">important</text><text start="1849.12" dur="4.72">lesson is i just want to start off by</text><text start="1852.48" dur="4.16">saying that</text><text start="1853.84" dur="4.4">like it is important to know that you</text><text start="1856.64" dur="5.12">are an asset to your team</text><text start="1858.24" dur="5.439">so even if like you&amp;#39;re still in school</text><text start="1861.76" dur="3.36">studying this working group projects or</text><text start="1863.679" dur="4.561">if you&amp;#39;re someone who&amp;#39;s working</text><text start="1865.12" dur="5.2">as a data scientist now like</text><text start="1868.24" dur="4.159">recognize that your skills are valuable</text><text start="1870.32" dur="3.44">you make an impact and that you would</text><text start="1872.399" dur="4.88">not get to the point</text><text start="1873.76" dur="7.36">where you are today if someone else</text><text start="1877.279" dur="6.321">didn&amp;#39;t recognize your potential and</text><text start="1881.12" dur="3.2">i know imposter syndrome gets thrown</text><text start="1883.6" dur="4">around</text><text start="1884.32" dur="4.8">a lot especially in our field and it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="1887.6" dur="2.959">going to make you always have that</text><text start="1889.12" dur="2.32">little voice in the back of your head</text><text start="1890.559" dur="2.881">that&amp;#39;s like</text><text start="1891.44" dur="3.68">oh no like i just got lucky they didn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="1893.44" dur="4.64">actually you know</text><text start="1895.12" dur="5.36">oh they didn&amp;#39;t actually read my</text><text start="1898.08" dur="4.88">application that closely or someone else</text><text start="1900.48" dur="6.24">you know should be here more than me</text><text start="1902.96" dur="5.04">and i know that&amp;#39;s not always hard to</text><text start="1906.72" dur="3.12">ignore but just</text><text start="1908" dur="3.44">definitely like take some time and</text><text start="1909.84" dur="2.959">recognize what are some things that</text><text start="1911.44" dur="4.4">you&amp;#39;re good at</text><text start="1912.799" dur="6.561">um to try to combat some of</text><text start="1915.84" dur="7.04">some of that stuff um</text><text start="1919.36" dur="6.72">and another thing that i think</text><text start="1922.88" dur="6">is why this being your own advocate</text><text start="1926.08" dur="4.719">is important falls under in relation to</text><text start="1928.88" dur="5.2">mentors and advocates</text><text start="1930.799" dur="6.321">um those are also very important</text><text start="1934.08" dur="3.68">um i&amp;#39;ll talk a little bit more about</text><text start="1937.12" dur="2.32">like</text><text start="1937.76" dur="3.519">how to go about finding those in the</text><text start="1939.44" dur="4.4">next couple slides but</text><text start="1941.279" dur="5.201">just some definitions to provide here so</text><text start="1943.84" dur="5.199">a mentor is somebody who</text><text start="1946.48" dur="3.84">i think of as like providing assistance</text><text start="1949.039" dur="2.64">and helping you out with career</text><text start="1950.32" dur="4.959">navigation</text><text start="1951.679" dur="5.761">so um i&amp;#39;ve had mentors who are</text><text start="1955.279" dur="3.921">data scientists i&amp;#39;ve also had mentors</text><text start="1957.44" dur="2.8">outside of the space who i typically go</text><text start="1959.2" dur="4.319">to more for</text><text start="1960.24" dur="5.6">just like professional questions but</text><text start="1963.519" dur="4.64">you would go to them to ask like oh hey</text><text start="1965.84" dur="4.64">i just i&amp;#39;m facing this situation at work</text><text start="1968.159" dur="3.921">how do you think i should proceed or</text><text start="1970.48" dur="3.199">they can really be helpful in guiding</text><text start="1972.08" dur="3.04">the next steps of your career and</text><text start="1973.679" dur="2.48">helping you figure out what you want to</text><text start="1975.12" dur="3.52">do</text><text start="1976.159" dur="4.081">on the other hand an advocate is</text><text start="1978.64" dur="3.68">somebody who is</text><text start="1980.24" dur="4.159">helping to actually create opportunities</text><text start="1982.32" dur="5.92">for you and will go to bat for you</text><text start="1984.399" dur="5.681">um so like this can typically be someone</text><text start="1988.24" dur="4.159">like a more senior member on your team</text><text start="1990.08" dur="5.36">or even your manager and that</text><text start="1992.399" dur="4.481">they know what you want to do and if</text><text start="1995.44" dur="2.959">something comes up that you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="1996.88" dur="2.24">interested in or that would benefit for</text><text start="1998.399" dur="2.801">you like</text><text start="1999.12" dur="4.559">they&amp;#39;ll go to whoever they need to and</text><text start="2001.2" dur="2.8">say like yes i hope like i support this</text><text start="2003.679" dur="2">person</text><text start="2004" dur="3.679">i think they&amp;#39;d be a great fit for it and</text><text start="2005.679" dur="5.441">really help you in that sense</text><text start="2007.679" dur="7.84">um so again they could be potentially</text><text start="2011.12" dur="6.399">the same person but also um there&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="2015.519" dur="3.76">pretty noticeable difference between the</text><text start="2017.519" dur="3.76">two</text><text start="2019.279" dur="3.921">and then the other reason why it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="2021.279" dur="4.481">important to be your own best</text><text start="2023.2" dur="3.12">advocate is how this can help you with</text><text start="2025.76" dur="4.56">career</text><text start="2026.32" dur="6.959">development so when you&amp;#39;re advocating</text><text start="2030.32" dur="4.64">for yourself you&amp;#39;ll definitely be more</text><text start="2033.279" dur="3.601">likely to have a direction that really</text><text start="2034.96" dur="3.04">interests you or work on projects that</text><text start="2036.88" dur="4.32">are more</text><text start="2038" dur="6.24">exciting to you um</text><text start="2041.2" dur="5.44">i think for me i do recognize that like</text><text start="2044.24" dur="4.56">saying career development</text><text start="2046.64" dur="3.759">especially after i just got in my first</text><text start="2048.8" dur="4.64">job seemed like a very</text><text start="2050.399" dur="4.561">overwhelming thing because i applied to</text><text start="2053.44" dur="4.399">so many jobs in the beginning</text><text start="2054.96" dur="4.639">i finally got one can take a breath but</text><text start="2057.839" dur="3.361">now it seems like oh well now i have to</text><text start="2059.599" dur="3.121">figure out what i want to do next and</text><text start="2061.2" dur="2.32">what do i want to work on and all of</text><text start="2062.72" dur="3.119">that</text><text start="2063.52" dur="3.92">um i&amp;#39;m going to touch on career</text><text start="2065.839" dur="3.52">development also in the next couple</text><text start="2067.44" dur="3.84">slides so don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="2069.359" dur="4.24">feel too overwhelmed by that because</text><text start="2071.28" dur="5.839">that&amp;#39;s something definitely</text><text start="2073.599" dur="6.32">i was um but it doesn&amp;#39;t have to be as</text><text start="2077.119" dur="4.24">like you don&amp;#39;t have to have a concrete</text><text start="2079.919" dur="2.72">five ten year plan</text><text start="2081.359" dur="3.201">there are other ways that you can think</text><text start="2082.639" dur="2.48">about it and advocate for yourself so</text><text start="2084.56" dur="2.279">that</text><text start="2085.119" dur="3.681">you end up just learning things that are</text><text start="2086.839" dur="3.961">interesting to you and really</text><text start="2088.8" dur="4.319">getting you closer to your own personal</text><text start="2090.8" dur="2.319">goals</text><text start="2096" dur="7.599">alright so how to then</text><text start="2099.599" dur="8">go about advocating for yourself</text><text start="2103.599" dur="6.24">one is the dreaded networking world word</text><text start="2107.599" dur="6">so it&amp;#39;s really important to network</text><text start="2109.839" dur="6">inside and outside of your company</text><text start="2113.599" dur="4.24">one way to do that first of all is to</text><text start="2115.839" dur="5.441">contribute to any regular</text><text start="2117.839" dur="4.641">regular summary content so</text><text start="2121.28" dur="3.52">different companies will do this</text><text start="2122.48" dur="4.08">differently but typically either once a</text><text start="2124.8" dur="2.72">week or once a month they&amp;#39;ll either have</text><text start="2126.56" dur="4.72">a meetup</text><text start="2127.52" dur="6.079">or a stand up or some sort of email or</text><text start="2131.28" dur="3.36">report that goes out that highlights</text><text start="2133.599" dur="2.561">you know what are some of the big</text><text start="2134.64" dur="3.36">projects or what are some of the things</text><text start="2136.16" dur="4.4">that people are working on</text><text start="2138" dur="3.76">so if they do that wherever you are</text><text start="2140.56" dur="3.12">definitely like</text><text start="2141.76" dur="3.68">think about contributing to that talking</text><text start="2143.68" dur="2.8">about the work that you&amp;#39;re doing getting</text><text start="2145.44" dur="4.08">it done</text><text start="2146.48" dur="4.639">if one doesn&amp;#39;t exist but it seems like</text><text start="2149.52" dur="3.04">the team&amp;#39;s big enough or the company&amp;#39;s</text><text start="2151.119" dur="2.48">big enough that would be like a good</text><text start="2152.56" dur="2.64">idea</text><text start="2153.599" dur="4.48">maybe think about like leading that</text><text start="2155.2" dur="6.879">initiative to start one um</text><text start="2158.079" dur="5.841">just again it&amp;#39;s especially at those</text><text start="2162.079" dur="2.881">larger companies you just want to make</text><text start="2163.92" dur="3.6">sure people</text><text start="2164.96" dur="4.56">recognize what you&amp;#39;re doing they see</text><text start="2167.52" dur="3.68">your name in relation to the work that</text><text start="2169.52" dur="5.28">you&amp;#39;re putting out there</text><text start="2171.2" dur="5.6">um another point to this that&amp;#39;s not</text><text start="2174.8" dur="3.6">necessarily about like contributing to</text><text start="2176.8" dur="4.319">regular summary content</text><text start="2178.4" dur="4.24">but typically a lot of companies will</text><text start="2181.119" dur="3.761">have like an annual review</text><text start="2182.64" dur="3.6">process so something that i&amp;#39;ll do is</text><text start="2184.88" dur="4">even just keep a</text><text start="2186.24" dur="4.96">like a note on my work computer of some</text><text start="2188.88" dur="4.32">of the big projects that i&amp;#39;m working on</text><text start="2191.2" dur="3.76">and what are either some of the big</text><text start="2193.2" dur="3.04">breakthroughs or the new skills that i</text><text start="2194.96" dur="4.399">picked up on that</text><text start="2196.24" dur="4.32">just because you know 12 months go by</text><text start="2199.359" dur="3.681">and it can be hard to remember</text><text start="2200.56" dur="3.279">everything that you did especially this</text><text start="2203.04" dur="3.68">year because</text><text start="2203.839" dur="3.441">three months feels like 10 years but</text><text start="2206.72" dur="2.72">just</text><text start="2207.28" dur="3.6">get used to keeping track of all the</text><text start="2209.44" dur="2.88">different things you&amp;#39;ve done and skills</text><text start="2210.88" dur="2.88">you&amp;#39;ve learned</text><text start="2212.32" dur="2.88">because that can come in handy when you</text><text start="2213.76" dur="5.2">then go at the end of the year to have</text><text start="2215.2" dur="3.76">those conversations with your manager</text><text start="2219.04" dur="4.16">another thing in terms of networking how</text><text start="2221.92" dur="2.96">to go about it</text><text start="2223.2" dur="4.159">and this is something that i like</text><text start="2224.88" dur="5.52">absolutely hated when i started out</text><text start="2227.359" dur="5.521">is just set up one-on-ones or</text><text start="2230.4" dur="4.08">to use sort of the business lingo coffee</text><text start="2232.88" dur="4.16">chats with people</text><text start="2234.48" dur="4.16">um this can be definitely the people</text><text start="2237.04" dur="4">inside a company if you already</text><text start="2238.64" dur="4.08">are working that either work</text><text start="2241.04" dur="4.24">tangentially</text><text start="2242.72" dur="3.119">tangent i can&amp;#39;t say that even a math</text><text start="2245.28" dur="3.12">person</text><text start="2245.839" dur="5.041">that work very closely with your team</text><text start="2248.4" dur="6.4">maybe or even in other departments</text><text start="2250.88" dur="5.6">um or if you&amp;#39;re a student or working to</text><text start="2254.8" dur="3.279">looking to break into data science it</text><text start="2256.48" dur="4">can also just be people</text><text start="2258.079" dur="4.081">that you find whose work that you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="2260.48" dur="5.04">interested in</text><text start="2262.16" dur="4.4">so for me i started out by like reaching</text><text start="2265.52" dur="3.52">out within</text><text start="2266.56" dur="3.039">an alumni network so whether that be</text><text start="2269.04" dur="3.6">through</text><text start="2269.599" dur="5.121">a college or if you do a boot camp or</text><text start="2272.64" dur="3.76">any sort of program like that oftentimes</text><text start="2274.72" dur="3.119">i&amp;#39;ll have a directory of people that you</text><text start="2276.4" dur="3.76">can reach out to</text><text start="2277.839" dur="4.161">um and that i found really helpful at</text><text start="2280.16" dur="5.28">least to start out with because</text><text start="2282" dur="4.32">i could then there was a common ground</text><text start="2285.44" dur="5.28">that i had</text><text start="2286.32" dur="6.24">um just that connection and</text><text start="2290.72" dur="3.52">i would also recommend for this like</text><text start="2292.56" dur="3.6">definitely plan some questions and</text><text start="2294.24" dur="3.52">talking points ahead of time</text><text start="2296.16" dur="3.76">i think for me i always found this</text><text start="2297.76" dur="4.64">stressful because it was like what if we</text><text start="2299.92" dur="5.199">don&amp;#39;t have anything to talk about and</text><text start="2302.4" dur="5.84">all of that but if you come with some</text><text start="2305.119" dur="4.24">questions ahead of time um and you get</text><text start="2308.24" dur="1.839">more practice with this you&amp;#39;ll</text><text start="2309.359" dur="4.321">definitely get</text><text start="2310.079" dur="7.121">more comfortable having those</text><text start="2313.68" dur="5.439">conversations with other people um</text><text start="2317.2" dur="3.44">and i will say too i think one of the</text><text start="2319.119" dur="3.601">biggest things that i</text><text start="2320.64" dur="3.68">why i did not like this at first as a</text><text start="2322.72" dur="3.76">student is i always felt like i was</text><text start="2324.32" dur="4.08">going out and asking people for things</text><text start="2326.48" dur="4.639">and not really having as much</text><text start="2328.4" dur="3.84">to offer in return but i&amp;#39;d say</text><text start="2331.119" dur="3.841">definitely like if people</text><text start="2332.24" dur="4.64">respond and are willing to talk with you</text><text start="2334.96" dur="3.76">like</text><text start="2336.88" dur="3.36">if you&amp;#39;re reaching out like as a student</text><text start="2338.72" dur="2.8">they probably already know that it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="2340.24" dur="3.119">going to be more of like answering</text><text start="2341.52" dur="3.599">questions but</text><text start="2343.359" dur="3.841">also know that like you don&amp;#39;t have to</text><text start="2345.119" dur="4.161">get really far in your career to then</text><text start="2347.2" dur="4.639">like have people that you network in</text><text start="2349.28" dur="3.52">network with have a benefit from knowing</text><text start="2351.839" dur="3.76">you as well</text><text start="2352.8" dur="3.68">it&amp;#39;s like for example like one to two</text><text start="2355.599" dur="3.201">years</text><text start="2356.48" dur="3.44">into my own career after i met someone</text><text start="2358.8" dur="3.52">at um</text><text start="2359.92" dur="3.6">an event that i went to like i ended up</text><text start="2362.32" dur="3.68">helping him find an</text><text start="2363.52" dur="4">intern to hire so just know that you</text><text start="2366" dur="3.92">don&amp;#39;t have to be</text><text start="2367.52" dur="4.559">like super senior or have done all these</text><text start="2369.92" dur="3.84">projects to necessarily have like a</text><text start="2372.079" dur="3.361">networking relationship</text><text start="2373.76" dur="3.04">where you&amp;#39;re also helping other people</text><text start="2375.44" dur="4.639">as well</text><text start="2376.8" dur="6.16">so then start with this last one um</text><text start="2380.079" dur="4.241">just so i&amp;#39;m not sure where i dropped off</text><text start="2382.96" dur="2.639">but</text><text start="2384.32" dur="4.16">so it&amp;#39;s really important when you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="2385.599" dur="6.401">reaching out to these people to do</text><text start="2388.48" dur="6.16">research before you send a message um</text><text start="2392"

that</text><text start="2416.48" dur="2.48">a lot of</text><text start="2417.28" dur="3.2">these people are probably receiving</text><text start="2418.96" dur="4.32">messages from like</text><text start="2420.48" dur="4.16">a ton of people and you want to make</text><text start="2423.28" dur="3.6">sure that you can</text><text start="2424.64" dur="4.64">differentiate yourself from the group a</text><text start="2426.88" dur="2.4">little bit</text><text start="2431.92" dur="5.04">so the other way that i apply this</text><text start="2435.44" dur="5.36">lesson then in my</text><text start="2436.96" dur="7.84">day today is actively thinking about</text><text start="2440.8" dur="8.16">career development so again this is</text><text start="2444.8" dur="6.24">something that when i first got my job</text><text start="2448.96" dur="3.04">my first data science job seemed very</text><text start="2451.04" dur="3.92">overwhelming</text><text start="2452" dur="4.96">of just finally i finished school i got</text><text start="2454.96" dur="3.52">the degree i landed a job like let&amp;#39;s</text><text start="2456.96" dur="3.119">take a deep breath and then it seemed</text><text start="2458.48" dur="3.119">like well no now i have to</text><text start="2460.079" dur="3.201">it&amp;#39;s very overwhelming to then think</text><text start="2461.599" dur="2.48">about okay what does the future look</text><text start="2463.28" dur="4">like</text><text start="2464.079" dur="5.28">um but i&amp;#39;m here to tell you it does not</text><text start="2467.28" dur="4">have to be that overwhelming</text><text start="2469.359" dur="3.76">so just a couple of things i&amp;#39;ve learned</text><text start="2471.28" dur="4.48">in regards to this</text><text start="2473.119" dur="3.441">so first of all in data science</text><text start="2475.76" dur="4.559">typically</text><text start="2476.56" dur="6.4">you&amp;#39;ll see um jobs</text><text start="2480.319" dur="4.081">or two different career paths exist of</text><text start="2482.96" dur="3.28">you can either</text><text start="2484.4" dur="5.04">become in what&amp;#39;s called an individual</text><text start="2486.24" dur="6.079">contributor or more of a management role</text><text start="2489.44" dur="4.879">so typically and again this isn&amp;#39;t the</text><text start="2492.319" dur="4.481">same for every company but</text><text start="2494.319" dur="4.481">you&amp;#39;ll come in as a data scientist there</text><text start="2496.8" dur="2.88">might be like one or two senior levels</text><text start="2498.8" dur="3.039">above that</text><text start="2499.68" dur="5.04">and then you get to like a fork in the</text><text start="2501.839" dur="3.921">road where one is that ic path one is a</text><text start="2504.72" dur="3.68">manager</text><text start="2505.76" dur="3.839">so what it means then to be an</text><text start="2508.4" dur="5.12">individual</text><text start="2509.599" dur="6.48">contributor is you are somebody who</text><text start="2513.52" dur="3.68">spends more time like writing code</text><text start="2516.079" dur="4.081">building models</text><text start="2517.2" dur="4.08">working on projects you might have one</text><text start="2520.16" dur="3.199">or two</text><text start="2521.28" dur="4.88">people report to you but at the end of</text><text start="2523.359" dur="4.881">the day more of your time is still spent</text><text start="2526.16" dur="4.32">like coding and doing the math and</text><text start="2528.24" dur="5.68">statistics side of things</text><text start="2530.48" dur="4.96">versus someone who goes more down a</text><text start="2533.92" dur="3.76">manager path</text><text start="2535.44" dur="4.399">they&amp;#39;ll be somebody who is like who&amp;#39;s</text><text start="2537.68" dur="4.399">leading a larger team</text><text start="2539.839" dur="4.321">and helping guide a lot more of this</text><text start="2542.079" dur="3.04">long-term strategy and priorities of</text><text start="2544.16" dur="3.04">things</text><text start="2545.119" dur="3.521">so you&amp;#39;ll typically they&amp;#39;ll typically</text><text start="2547.2" dur="3.36">spend a little bit more time</text><text start="2548.64" dur="3.439">in meetings in terms of understanding</text><text start="2550.56" dur="2.4">different requests that come in for the</text><text start="2552.079" dur="2.401">team</text><text start="2552.96" dur="3.84">figure out can they take on more</text><text start="2554.48" dur="5.28">requests what has more priority</text><text start="2556.8" dur="5.6">and they&amp;#39;ll also they&amp;#39;re responsible for</text><text start="2559.76" dur="4.8">more people and will also typically</text><text start="2562.4" dur="3.679">play a large part in career development</text><text start="2564.56" dur="3.68">for their team as well</text><text start="2566.079" dur="3.361">so again that&amp;#39;s just something that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="2568.24" dur="4.56">good to know</text><text start="2569.44" dur="5.12">um because as you&amp;#39;re working on</text><text start="2572.8" dur="2.72">different projects and doing different</text><text start="2574.56" dur="3.279">things</text><text start="2575.52" dur="3.2">it&amp;#39;s just good to get a sense of to this</text><text start="2577.839" dur="3.441">next point</text><text start="2578.72" dur="3.84">what type of work makes you happy like</text><text start="2581.28" dur="3.2">if you find yourself</text><text start="2582.56" dur="4.72">hating going to all these meetings</text><text start="2584.48" dur="4.639">around project planning and all of that</text><text start="2587.28" dur="3.2">that&amp;#39;s probably okay if you don&amp;#39;t like</text><text start="2589.119" dur="4.561">that maybe management</text><text start="2590.48" dur="5.68">isn&amp;#39;t necessarily what you want um</text><text start="2593.68" dur="3.76">but definitely just even thinking about</text><text start="2596.16" dur="5.199">what types of work</text><text start="2597.44" dur="6.159">makes you happy is really important</text><text start="2601.359" dur="4.081">um because again you don&amp;#39;t have to make</text><text start="2603.599" dur="3.841">this crazy five-year plan</text><text start="2605.44" dur="3.84">but in your day-to-day think about what</text><text start="2607.44" dur="4.8">are the things that you enjoy</text><text start="2609.28" dur="4.48">what are your favorite things to do like</text><text start="2612.24" dur="2.96">what is the stuff that you don&amp;#39;t quite</text><text start="2613.76" dur="3.12">look forward to doing what do you want</text><text start="2615.2" dur="5.6">to learn more about</text><text start="2616.88" dur="4.88">so for me i found for example that i</text><text start="2620.8" dur="4.48">really liked</text><text start="2621.76" dur="5.68">being able to be like the person</text><text start="2625.28" dur="3.92">in between data science and the people</text><text start="2627.44" dur="3.04">that we work with in terms of</text><text start="2629.2" dur="2.8">like i still spend a lot of my</text><text start="2630.48" dur="2.72">day-to-day writing code and building</text><text start="2632" dur="4.16">models but</text><text start="2633.2" dur="3.36">i really liked being able to take all</text><text start="2636.16" dur="3.199">the</text><text start="2636.56" dur="4.96">analysis that i did and help somebody</text><text start="2639.359" dur="2.881">who wasn&amp;#39;t in data science do their job</text><text start="2641.52" dur="2.72">better</text><text start="2642.24" dur="3.52">or answer their questions or really help</text><text start="2644.24" dur="3.599">shape that</text><text start="2645.76" dur="4.559">um like answer their questions that</text><text start="2647.839" dur="5.441">might be shaping the overall strategy</text><text start="2650.319" dur="4">and then i&amp;#39;ve also found i personally</text><text start="2653.28" dur="3.44">really enjoy</text><text start="2654.319" dur="4.401">the opportunities i&amp;#39;ve had with</text><text start="2656.72" dur="2.72">mentoring more junior employees and</text><text start="2658.72" dur="3.359">helping them</text><text start="2659.44" dur="3.84">start out some of their first projects</text><text start="2662.079" dur="3.921">so</text><text start="2663.28" dur="4.16">for me personally it&amp;#39;s like okay that</text><text start="2666" dur="2.319">means at this point like i&amp;#39;m more</text><text start="2667.44" dur="2.879">interested in</text><text start="2668.319" dur="4.241">probably thinking about that manager</text><text start="2670.319" dur="4.481">path but again like career development</text><text start="2672.56" dur="3.92">doesn&amp;#39;t have to be this crazy</text><text start="2674.8" dur="3.44">i&amp;#39;m going to have all the details of my</text><text start="2676.48" dur="3.68">next few years planned out it can be as</text><text start="2678.24" dur="4.32">simple as identifying what do you like</text><text start="2680.16" dur="5.439">to do what don&amp;#39;t you like to do</text><text start="2682.56" dur="5.2">and once you figure that out</text><text start="2685.599" dur="4.24">it&amp;#39;s really important that you share</text><text start="2687.76" dur="4.16">those goals and don&amp;#39;t be quiet about</text><text start="2689.839" dur="3.921">what you want</text><text start="2691.92" dur="3.439">so this is a great thing to just talk</text><text start="2693.76" dur="3.12">about with your manager and some of your</text><text start="2695.359" dur="4.401">other colleagues</text><text start="2696.88" dur="4.719">because if they know what you want like</text><text start="2699.76" dur="2.559">for example your manager is going to be</text><text start="2701.599" dur="3.041">aware of</text><text start="2702.319" dur="4.161">opportunities and upcoming projects</text><text start="2704.64" dur="5.439">often times before you are</text><text start="2706.48" dur="5.92">and if they know like okay hey like</text><text start="2710.079" dur="3.841">megan really likes working with more</text><text start="2712.4" dur="3.28">junior employees that she can help</text><text start="2713.92" dur="3.679">mentor and build their skills like</text><text start="2715.68" dur="4.159">here&amp;#39;s a project where i know like she</text><text start="2717.599" dur="6.641">could take more of a leadership role in</text><text start="2719.839" dur="6.321">so don&amp;#39;t be afraid to talk about that</text><text start="2724.24" dur="5.92">because you want other people just to be</text><text start="2726.16" dur="4">aware of what you&amp;#39;re interested in as</text><text start="2730.839" dur="5">well</text><text start="2732.8" dur="7.12">so then to wrap it up with just a quick</text><text start="2735.839" dur="6.321">summary of what the three lessons are so</text><text start="2739.92" dur="4">first of all better accuracy doesn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="2742.16" dur="2.88">necessarily mean that it&amp;#39;s a better</text><text start="2743.92" dur="3.52">model</text><text start="2745.04" dur="3.44">at the end of the day your best solution</text><text start="2747.44" dur="3.919">is going to be the one</text><text start="2748.48" dur="4.4">that meets the project means but also</text><text start="2751.359" dur="4.081">really makes the best use</text><text start="2752.88" dur="4.239">of time and money when compared to your</text><text start="2755.44" dur="4">other priorities</text><text start="2757.119" dur="3.2">again it&amp;#39;s a lot easier said than done</text><text start="2759.44" dur="2.8">in that</text><text start="2760.319" dur="4.561">sentence there but this is something</text><text start="2762.24" dur="5.76">that you&amp;#39;ll get a better sense of</text><text start="2764.88" dur="4.88">as you start doing more projects</text><text start="2768" dur="3.68">it&amp;#39;s also really important to develop</text><text start="2769.76" dur="3.28">strong communication skills</text><text start="2771.68" dur="3.439">you need that so you can build</text><text start="2773.04" dur="4.96">relationships with other teams</text><text start="2775.119" dur="4.321">um build a sense of trust among the</text><text start="2778" dur="4.24">people that you&amp;#39;re working with</text><text start="2779.44" dur="3.2">and it can also be great if you do want</text><text start="2782.24" dur="2">to</text><text start="2782.64" dur="4">pursue some opportunities in terms of</text><text start="2784.24" dur="5.92">speaking at conferences or at meetups</text><text start="2786.64" dur="5.12">and then lastly know that you are your</text><text start="2790.16" dur="4.72">own best advocate</text><text start="2791.76" dur="5.359">so even when that imposter syndrome</text><text start="2794.88" dur="4.8">creeps in and you doubt yourself don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="2797.119" dur="4.48">be afraid to speak up for yourself</text><text start="2799.68" dur="3.2">to your home your own horn about your</text><text start="2801.599" dur="3.76">accomplishments and</text><text start="2802.88" dur="4.16">really be sure to go after what it is</text><text start="2805.359" dur="3.041">you want and just make sure that you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="2807.04" dur="4.72">sharing your career goals</text><text start="2808.4" dur="3.36">with the people that you work with</text><text start="2812.88" dur="3.84">and that&amp;#39;s what i have for you guys</text><text start="2815.52" dur="4.319">today</text><text start="2816.72" dur="5.119">so here i have my twitter handle as well</text><text start="2819.839"

can</text><text start="2826.319" dur="2.8">definitely</text><text start="2827.28" dur="3.6">dm me on twitter or i have like a</text><text start="2829.119" dur="4.881">contact field on my

dur="3.84">megan so</text><text start="2837.92" dur="3.52">there is a question in the q a i could</text><text start="2840.88" dur="3.36">read it</text><text start="2841.44" dur="3.44">from sandeep it is related to the first</text><text start="2844.24" dur="3.04">section</text><text start="2844.88" dur="4.56">could you highlight some of the at-scale</text><text start="2847.28" dur="2.64">computing methodologies that you found</text><text start="2849.44" dur="4.48">to be</text><text start="2849.92" dur="7.439">key the best ways to learn them</text><text start="2853.92" dur="6">yeah for sure um so</text><text start="2857.359" dur="3.921">i&amp;#39;d say for me personally the biggest</text><text start="2859.92" dur="4.08">things that i&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="2861.28" dur="4">learned that has been helpful um has</text><text start="2864" dur="4.64">been using</text><text start="2865.28" dur="7.36">pi spark um</text><text start="2868.64" dur="6.959">in terms of the best way to like</text><text start="2872.64" dur="4.4">learn it right now it&amp;#39;s a little</text><text start="2875.599" dur="3.121">different because i feel like when i was</text><text start="2877.04" dur="3.2">in school there wasn&amp;#39;t as much of a</text><text start="2878.72" dur="4.24">focus on like big</text><text start="2880.24" dur="5.359">data computing so i personally just</text><text start="2882.96" dur="4.639">learned a lot of them by</text><text start="2885.599" dur="3.281">okay here&amp;#39;s this problem i have at work</text><text start="2887.599" dur="5.441">and we got to get it done</text><text start="2888.88" dur="7.28">somehow so kind of trial by fire um</text><text start="2893.04" dur="4.16">but i&amp;#39;d say like figuring out one good</text><text start="2896.16" dur="2.48">thing to really</text><text start="2897.2" dur="3.6">learn more about like i was saying</text><text start="2898.64" dur="5.679">before is parallel computing</text><text start="2900.8" dur="6.4">so pi spark you can actually use</text><text start="2904.319" dur="3.601">that like implementation of using the</text><text start="2907.2" dur="4.48">spark</text><text start="2907.92" dur="6">language in python that can help you run</text><text start="2911.68" dur="4.96">things in parallel</text><text start="2913.92" dur="5.36">and i honestly like i said a lot of i</text><text start="2916.64" dur="5.679">learned was just like i need to figure</text><text start="2919.28" dur="5.279">this out um</text><text start="2922.319" dur="4.321">but i would say definitely look into</text><text start="2924.559" dur="5.201">parallel computing</text><text start="2926.64" dur="5.439">the spark language</text><text start="2929.76" dur="4.4">um just because there&amp;#39;s a lot of stuff</text><text start="2932.079" dur="2.561">that fits in there in terms of figuring</text><text start="2934.16" dur="2.56">out</text><text start="2934.64" dur="4.8">or that explains like how it works and</text><text start="2936.72" dur="5.68">what the difference is between</text><text start="2939.44" dur="4">the terminology that they use and then i</text><text start="2942.4" dur="4.64">would say just</text><text start="2943.44" dur="6">go and like find some large data set</text><text start="2947.04" dur="4.079">um there&amp;#39;s some machine learning data</text><text start="2949.44" dur="2.72">repositories out there with some good</text><text start="2951.119" dur="3.281">data sets of just</text><text start="2952.16" dur="4.159">download it and like just start trying</text><text start="2954.4" dur="4.719">to write code and see</text><text start="2956.319" dur="5.441">okay if i just fit a model like this</text><text start="2959.119" dur="4.48">versus if i maybe use like that pi spark</text><text start="2961.76" dur="2.559">in parallel for example like being able</text><text start="2963.599" dur="3.76">to see</text><text start="2964.319" dur="4.561">that difference but um</text><text start="2967.359" dur="3.281">on the top of my head i can&amp;#39;t really</text><text start="2968.88" dur="5.12">think of any particular</text><text start="2970.64" dur="5.76">good resources but that&amp;#39;s also because i</text><text start="2974" dur="4.96">just kind of had to learn this by trial</text><text start="2976.4" dur="2.56">by fire</text><text start="2980.72" dur="6.639">um question is from sandra and</text><text start="2984.24" dur="4">um she asks how do you share your</text><text start="2987.359" dur="2.321">accomplishments</text><text start="2988.24"

beginning</text><text start="3001.28" dur="8.079">um so i think how i</text><text start="3005.839" dur="5.681">typically go about it is</text><text start="3009.359" dur="3.921">well one i just start by thinking about</text><text start="3011.52" dur="5.12">okay what are</text><text start="3013.28" dur="5.2">my accomplishments like if i could say</text><text start="3016.64" dur="3.76">anything for example like what would i</text><text start="3018.48" dur="4.4">want to go out and like either</text><text start="3020.4" dur="3.919">put on like a linkedin bullet point or</text><text start="3022.88" dur="3.84">something like that</text><text start="3024.319" dur="3.361">and then from there i kind of work</text><text start="3026.72" dur="4.399">backwards</text><text start="3027.68" dur="5.6">in terms of like okay well what do i</text><text start="3031.119" dur="5.361">know i definitely can&amp;#39;t</text><text start="3033.28" dur="5.68">talk about um</text><text start="3036.48" dur="4.72">and then once i get to like i have sort</text><text start="3038.96" dur="4">of not a watered-down version but like</text><text start="3041.2" dur="2.96">removing some of that proprietary or</text><text start="3042.96" dur="5.28">confidential stuff</text><text start="3044.16" dur="6.48">then typically i&amp;#39;ll like ask my manager</text><text start="3048.24" dur="3.92">or like talk

to i know this sounds like</text><text start="3058.48" dur="5.76">a very vague</text><text start="3060.72" dur="5.52">answer um just because</text><text start="3064.24" dur="3.839">for me like because i&amp;#39;m technically</text><text start="3066.24" dur="3.2">giving an external presentation this</text><text start="3068.079" dur="3.361">answer i&amp;#39;m giving is very different than</text><text start="3069.44" dur="5.2">what i would tell you individually</text><text start="3071.44" dur="5.04">but um i would say there&amp;#39;s definitely</text><text start="3074.64" dur="4.32">like think about</text><text start="3076.48" dur="4.32">could you talk about like maybe you</text><text start="3078.96" dur="4.159">worked on developing a new feature for</text><text start="3080.8" dur="4.48">something and you know it impacted like</text><text start="3083.119" dur="3.041">ex customers like usually something like</text><text start="3085.28" dur="3.36">that um</text><text start="3086.16" dur="4.08">quantifying it that way you can usually</text><text start="3088.64" dur="3.28">do as long as you&amp;#39;re not</text><text start="3090.24" dur="4.599">you know talking about that underlying</text><text start="3091.92" dur="5.919">model or technology that you use for</text><text start="3094.839" dur="3">that</text><text start="3098.079" dur="3.52">okay the next question is from kenisha</text><text start="3100.64" dur="2.959">which is</text><text start="3101.599" dur="4.321">when you first started in industry were</text><text start="3103.599" dur="2.72">there any technology or techniques that</text><text start="3105.92" dur="2.08">we</text><text start="3106.319" dur="3.441">that you didn&amp;#39;t know how to use or do</text><text start="3108" dur="4">that were necessary for the job</text><text start="3109.76" dur="3.839">and if so how were you able to learn it</text><text start="3112" dur="4.559">was it via company training</text><text start="3113.599" dur="2.96">or self training</text><text start="3116.64" dur="3.6">yeah so i think for me definitely the</text><text start="3119.599" dur="3.361">biggest</text><text start="3120.24" dur="3.839">thing was just figuring out how to work</text><text start="3122.96" dur="4.879">with</text><text start="3124.079" dur="6.801">very large data sets i think i had</text><text start="3127.839" dur="4.641">maybe one lecture in grad school where</text><text start="3130.88" dur="4.8">the professor was like</text><text start="3132.48" dur="5.92">this is aws and</text><text start="3135.68" dur="4.159">i honestly didn&amp;#39;t remember anything from</text><text start="3138.4" dur="4.32">that so i think</text><text start="3139.839" dur="5.121">definitely like learning that cloud</text><text start="3142.72" dur="5.28">computing stuff was helpful</text><text start="3144.96" dur="5.76">that was a combination of just</text><text start="3148" dur="4.16">having people either on my team who had</text><text start="3150.72" dur="4.879">background in that really help</text><text start="3152.16" dur="6.48">out learn that but also just kind of</text><text start="3155.599" dur="3.601">diving into a project where i needed to</text><text start="3158.64" dur="3.04">know it</text><text start="3159.2" dur="5.52">and looking at code that was either on</text><text start="3161.68" dur="4.639">blog post or elsewhere in applying it</text><text start="3164.72" dur="4.08">i do think that there&amp;#39;s a lot more out</text><text start="3166.319" dur="7.201">there in terms about</text><text start="3168.8" dur="6.72">um having like just the background</text><text start="3173.52" dur="3.599">of how these different technologies work</text><text start="3175.52" dur="4.48">so i&amp;#39;d say that&amp;#39;s definitely one thing</text><text start="3177.119" dur="4.96">i&amp;#39;ve learned a lot about on the job</text><text start="3180" dur="3.04">and then the other thing i think would</text><text start="3182.079" dur="3.361">just be</text><text start="3183.04" dur="3.76">like database querying so i personally</text><text start="3185.44" dur="4.639">use sql</text><text start="3186.8" dur="3.68">and part of that i feel like it was my</text><text start="3190.079" dur="3.201">first</text><text start="3190.48" dur="3.52">i i had done like the sql course on like</text><text start="3193.28" dur="3.279">khan academy</text><text start="3194" dur="5.04">or something which was very good but</text><text start="3196.559" dur="2.881">until i had that like first internship</text><text start="3199.04" dur="2.64">where</text><text start="3199.44" dur="4.08">i was actually going through and</text><text start="3201.68" dur="4">generating features from the data and</text><text start="3203.52" dur="4.48">joining tables like</text><text start="3205.68" dur="4">then i really felt like i mastered sql</text><text start="3208" dur="3.52">so i think for both of those it&amp;#39;s really</text><text start="3209.68" dur="3.84">a combination of</text><text start="3211.52" dur="3.12">like doing an online course or reading</text><text start="3213.52" dur="5.92">blog post but then</text><text start="3214.64" dur="4.8">also like having to implement it on my</text><text start="3220.839" dur="4.601">own</text><text start="3222.64" dur="4.08">okay thank you uh the next question is</text><text start="3225.44" dur="3.2">from kailande</text><text start="3226.72" dur="3.92">which is do you think it is essential to</text><text start="3228.64" dur="4.719">have a data science internship before</text><text start="3230.64" dur="5.199">landing one&amp;#39;s first full-time position</text><text start="3233.359" dur="4.161">specifically for people with non-cs</text><text start="3235.839" dur="3.601">computer science backgrounds but with</text><text start="3237.52" dur="3.44">data experience with r and python</text><text start="3239.44" dur="4">through quantitative research</text><text start="3240.96" dur="6">experiences</text><text start="3243.44" dur="5.28">yeah so i think that it&amp;#39;s definitely</text><text start="3246.96" dur="5.76">helpful to have</text><text start="3248.72" dur="5.44">an internship um it&amp;#39;s not necessarily</text><text start="3252.72" dur="3.2">going to be</text><text start="3254.16" dur="3.36">a deal breaker all the time again</text><text start="3255.92" dur="4.639">that&amp;#39;ll depend on</text><text start="3257.52" dur="5.68">the company as well but i think</text><text start="3260.559" dur="4.401">when we&amp;#39;re like when a company is</text><text start="3263.2" dur="3.359">looking to hire a data scientist they</text><text start="3264.96" dur="4.72">really want somebody who</text><text start="3266.559" dur="6.321">has um like</text><text start="3269.68" dur="5.04">a quantitative background so just</text><text start="3272.88" dur="3.679">in terms of understanding like</text><text start="3274.72" dur="3.44">probability like</text><text start="3276.559" dur="3.681">intro stats maybe a little bit of</text><text start="3278.16" dur="5.12">machine learning um</text><text start="3280.24" dur="4.48">it&amp;#39;s great that you&amp;#39;ll know code um</text><text start="3283.28" dur="4">but i think as long as you can</text><text start="3284.72" dur="5.2">demonstrate that</text><text start="3287.28" dur="4.16">you have the different skills necessary</text><text start="3289.92" dur="4.159">to be able to take</text><text start="3291.44" dur="4.72">some sort of business question or</text><text start="3294.079" dur="3.921">request</text><text start="3296.16" dur="3.28">think about it figure out how you can</text><text start="3298" dur="2.559">translate that into something</text><text start="3299.44" dur="3.52">quantitative</text><text start="3300.559" dur="3.921">that you can look at with the data that</text><text start="3302.96" dur="3.76">you have</text><text start="3304.48" dur="4.16">be able to run whatever analysis you</text><text start="3306.72" dur="2.32">think makes sense and then communicate</text><text start="3308.64" dur="2.32">that</text><text start="3309.04" dur="4.24">back to whoever it is you&amp;#39;re working</text><text start="3310.96" dur="4.639">with like that&amp;#39;s fundamentally what a</text><text start="3313.28" dur="4.96">data scientist does and what companies</text><text start="3315.599" dur="4.081">are interested in so yes having an</text><text start="3318.24" dur="1.76">internship can be a great way to get</text><text start="3319.68" dur="3.119">that</text><text start="3320" dur="3.359">experience but you can also demonstrate</text><text start="3322.799" dur="2.481">that</text><text start="3323.359" dur="4.96">with other ways i think one of the</text><text start="3325.28" dur="5.12">biggest questions i&amp;#39;ll always get is</text><text start="3328.319" dur="3.121">i&amp;#39;m trying to find my first data science</text><text start="3330.4" dur="3.199">job but</text><text start="3331.44" dur="4">i don&amp;#39;t have any experience how can i</text><text start="3333.599" dur="3.52">get experience if i don&amp;#39;t have one</text><text start="3335.44" dur="3.359">so you can also think about like the</text><text start="3337.119" dur="3.601">stuff that you&amp;#39;re doing either in school</text><text start="3338.799" dur="2.961">or even in your free time or through</text><text start="3340.72" dur="3.359">kaggle</text><text start="3341.76" dur="3.599">just think about okay what where can i</text><text start="3344.079" dur="3.28">take a data set</text><text start="3345.359" dur="3.521">find that interesting story using my</text><text start="3347.359" dur="2.96">technical skills</text><text start="3348.88" dur="3.76">and be able to communicate what&amp;#39;s</text><text start="3350.319" dur="4.081">important from it so again like</text><text start="3352.64" dur="3.52">data science will help with that an</text><text start="3354.4" dur="5.439">internship will help with that but it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="3356.16" dur="3.679">not necessarily a deal breaker</text><text start="3361.119" dur="3.281">okay the next question is from neely</text><text start="3363.04" dur="3.36">which is could you share</text><text start="3364.4" dur="4.8">more about how you landed your first</text><text start="3366.4" dur="6.24">data science job out of grad school</text><text start="3369.2" dur="6.8">uh yes um so</text><text start="3372.64" dur="7.04">i will say that i first</text><text start="3376" dur="7.359">started out in a very inefficient manner</text><text start="3379.68" dur="4.96">of coming out of school i was like okay</text><text start="3383.359" dur="2.96">well</text><text start="3384.64" dur="3.679">i&amp;#39;m just going to apply to as many</text><text start="3386.319" dur="4.641">places as possible because</text><text start="3388.319" dur="4.321">at the end of the day somebody will like</text><text start="3390.96" dur="5.119">respond to me</text><text start="3392.64" dur="6.64">um and yes that was</text><text start="3396.079" dur="5.921">true but i found that it was a lot</text><text start="3399.28" dur="3.6">of you know effort and time put into</text><text start="3402" dur="2.559">submitting these</text><text start="3402.88" dur="3.84">online applications and i wasn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="3404.559" dur="5.601">necessarily seeing the return that i got</text><text start="3406.72" dur="6.639">that i would have wanted and i think</text><text start="3410.16" dur="4.48">like part way through that process i</text><text start="3413.359" dur="2.96">from like reaching out to some of my</text><text start="3414.64" dur="2.8">other classmates or just people that i</text><text start="3416.319" dur="4">knew</text><text start="3417.44" dur="4.72">um in the area i kind of shifted my</text><text start="3420.319" dur="3.921">approach to them more thinking about</text><text start="3422.16" dur="5.52">like</text><text start="3424.24" dur="7.92">building a network as a way to go about</text><text start="3427.68" dur="6.56">finding jobs so the reality is like if a</text><text start="3432.16" dur="3.84">company posts a data science</text><text start="3434.24" dur="4.559">position typically they really get</text><text start="3436" dur="5.68">inundated with a ton of applicants</text><text start="3438.799" dur="4.401">so even if you are the most qualified</text><text start="3441.68" dur="3.52">qualified applicant at the end of the</text><text start="3443.2" dur="3.599">day like you might your resume just</text><text start="3445.2" dur="4.159">might get buried and like</text><text start="3446.799" dur="5.921">because so many people are applying so i</text><text start="3449.359" dur="5.521">shifted more towards of like</text><text start="3452.72" dur="3.76">focusing on networking but networking</text><text start="3454.88" dur="3.199">with the sense of like i definitely want</text><text start="3456.48" dur="3.599">to make sure that i&amp;#39;m connecting with</text><text start="3458.079" dur="3.841">people who are working at companies i&amp;#39;m</text><text start="3460.079" dur="4.081">interested or areas</text><text start="3461.92" dur="4.639">like specific areas that i&amp;#39;m interested</text><text start="3464.16" dur="6.159">in um</text><text start="3466.559" dur="5.52">just because again like i i do not</text><text start="3470.319" dur="2.8">recommend going out and just asking</text><text start="3472.079" dur="4">random people</text><text start="3473.119" dur="4.401">to refer you to a job but i found that</text><text start="3476.079" dur="3.52">like if you</text><text start="3477.52" dur="3.599">go out and like have conversations and</text><text start="3479.599" dur="2.561">ask them like what it&amp;#39;s like to work at</text><text start="3481.119" dur="3.281">their company</text><text start="3482.16" dur="3.679">and all of that stuff like a lot of</text><text start="3484.4" dur="2.719">times it would just come up organically</text><text start="3485.839" dur="3.52">they&amp;#39;d say oh if you see a position</text><text start="3487.119" dur="4.161">you&amp;#39;re interested in let me know and</text><text start="3489.359" dur="3.521">sometimes there wasn&amp;#39;t a position open</text><text start="3491.28" dur="3.039">at that company but down the line like</text><text start="3492.88" dur="4.32">something came up that i could</text><text start="3494.319" dur="4.721">talk to them about so again i did have</text><text start="3497.2" dur="3.52">success in terms of i got</text><text start="3499.04" dur="3.759">job offers from just applying on</text><text start="3500.72" dur="3.359">websites but i found that my time was</text><text start="3502.799" dur="4.721">much more effect</text><text start="3504.079" dur="5.441">effective in taking that networking</text><text start="3507.52" dur="2.48">approach well yes i&amp;#39;m still job hunting</text><text start="3509.52" dur="1.839">but</text><text start="3510" dur="3.359">there&amp;#39;s also just a lot of great</text><text start="3511.359" dur="6.48">information that i learned along the way</text><text start="3513.359" dur="4.48">about working in data science as well</text><text start="3518.88" dur="4">okay the next question is from sandeep</text><text start="3521.04" dur="3.519">could you please provide some pointers</text><text start="3522.88" dur="3.679">on deciding on a domain</text><text start="3524.559" dur="4.24">even if i don&amp;#39;t have much experience in</text><text start="3526.559" dur="4.321">it i&amp;#39;m sure you found it cool to find a</text><text

so</text><text start="3538.48" dur="4.16">i think one of the cool things about</text><text start="3540.48" dur="5.68">data science is it basically</text><text start="3542.64" dur="5.76">you can like every company has it for</text><text start="3546.16" dur="4.72">the most part or not company but</text><text start="3548.4" dur="4.399">you can be in retail you can be in</text><text start="3550.88" dur="4.4">sports you can be in medicine all over</text><text start="3552.799" dur="5.681">the place and</text><text start="3555.28" dur="6.16">i think for me like my</text><text start="3558.48" dur="5.839">initial job right out of school i was</text><text start="3561.44" dur="6.24">working for a now defunct company</text><text start="3564.319" dur="6.561">that um like tracked engagement for</text><text start="3567.68" dur="4.96">online publications so wasn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="3570.88" dur="2.479">necessarily something that i was</text><text start="3572.64" dur="4">personally</text><text start="3573.359" dur="6.801">super interested in but i think for me i</text><text start="3576.64" dur="6.8">saw the opportunity of</text><text start="3580.16" dur="4.72">like i knew i wanted to be in a position</text><text start="3583.44" dur="2.96">where i could be working a lot with a</text><text start="3584.88" dur="2.32">lot of different teams and

was</text><text start="3592.96" dur="4.24">when i had</text><text start="3594.4" dur="3.679">interviewed and like meeting the people</text><text start="3597.2" dur="3.2">that i</text><text

start="3616.24" dur="6.879">within the company as well as helping</text><text start="3618.319" dur="7.28">his employees to develop so i would say</text><text start="3623.119" dur="4.161">like definitely if it&amp;#39;s in an industry</text><text start="3625.599" dur="2.401">you&amp;#39;re not familiar with kind of just</text><text start="3627.28" dur="2.559">see</text><text start="3628" dur="3.839">get a sense of what sort of projects</text><text start="3629.839" dur="3.601">that they&amp;#39;re working on because like my</text><text start="3631.839" dur="5.361">first job i was definitely</text><text start="3633.44" dur="6.24">not passionate about online</text><text start="3637.2" dur="3.119">art like online publication engagement</text><text start="3639.68" dur="3.919">metrics</text><text start="3640.319" dur="5.601">but i did find that</text><text start="3643.599" dur="3.041">there was a really big benefit in terms</text><text start="3645.92" dur="2.399">of like</text><text start="3646.64" dur="4.32">being able to work with the team that i</text><text start="3648.319" dur="5.441">was in and the projects that the team</text><text start="3650.96" dur="4.72">was working on like i got to learn</text><text start="3653.76" dur="4.319">new things obviously about that area but</text><text start="3655.68" dur="4.159">also things that really interested me in</text><text start="3658.079" dur="5.52">terms of new</text><text start="3659.839" dur="3.76">techniques that i hadn&amp;#39;t learned before</text><text start="3666.319" dur="3.921">yeah and you know just to add to that i</text><text start="3668.079" dur="3.921">think one thing that i&amp;#39;ve learned is it</text><text start="3670.24" dur="3.359">is interesting like how many</text><text start="3672" dur="3.52">how much skills and knowledge from one</text><text start="3673.599" dur="4.161">domain are transferable to another</text><text start="3675.52" dur="4.72">domain</text><text start="3677.76" dur="2.48">for sure</text><text start="3680.799" dur="4.481">next question is from neely which is um</text><text start="3683.599" dur="3.76">yes we have time for question</text><text start="3685.28" dur="3.6">do you have any tips on writing good or</text><text start="3687.359" dur="4.801">effective data science</text><text start="3688.88" dur="3.28">linkedin bullet points</text><text start="3692.319" dur="5.361">yeah so i think for that um</text><text start="3695.76" dur="3.92">i think a common thing that gets thrown</text><text start="3697.68" dur="5.119">around that</text><text start="3699.68" dur="6.08">i do agree with um</text><text start="3702.799" dur="4.721">is it can be helpful to try to figure</text><text start="3705.76" dur="5.039">out a way to quantify</text><text start="3707.52" dur="6.88">like projects that you&amp;#39;re working on so</text><text start="3710.799" dur="6.161">if you did a project that like</text><text start="3714.4" dur="5.439">influenced like say some marketing</text><text start="3716.96" dur="3.68">campaign for 50 000 people for example</text><text start="3719.839" dur="4.48">or</text><text start="3720.64" dur="7.12">you know if you implemented an</text><text start="3724.319" dur="6.24">a b test that ultimately like</text><text start="3727.76" dur="3.2">your recommendation cause like x dollars</text><text start="3730.559" dur="3.601">and</text><text start="3730.96" dur="3.839">increase in revenue or something um i&amp;#39;d</text><text start="3734.16" dur="3.919">say</text><text start="3734.799" dur="5.921">that&amp;#39;s definitely put that in there</text><text start="3738.079" dur="3.04">um because that can be very helpful for</text><text start="3740.72" dur="3.359">when</text><text start="3741.119" dur="4.561">somebody who&amp;#39;s maybe not as familiar</text><text start="3744.079" dur="2.401">with the data science is looking at it</text><text start="3745.68" dur="2.879">so like maybe</text><text start="3746.48" dur="4.4">someone who&amp;#39;s an hr is in charge of</text><text start="3748.559" dur="4.721">hiring for a position for example</text><text start="3750.88" dur="4.32">because like by seeing a number they&amp;#39;ll</text><text start="3753.28" dur="6.079">at least be able to get a sense of</text><text start="3755.2" dur="8.24">the impact of it um i think also</text><text start="3759.359" dur="6.641">highlighting any instances where you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="3763.44" dur="4.32">like i feel like teamwork is always</text><text start="3766" dur="4">something that can sometimes get</text><text start="3767.76" dur="4.4">overlooked</text><text start="3770" dur="4.4">so talking about like the teams that</text><text start="3772.16" dur="5.199">you&amp;#39;ve worked with or collaborated with</text><text start="3774.4" dur="4.88">because at the end of the day like</text><text start="3777.359" dur="3.281">maybe if you&amp;#39;re at some super research</text><text start="3779.28" dur="3.2">heavy position but</text><text start="3780.64" dur="3.52">otherwise you&amp;#39;re going to be working</text><text start="3782.48" dur="3.599">with people who aren&amp;#39;t data scientists</text><text start="3784.16" dur="4.879">so they want to get a sense of</text><text start="3786.079" dur="3.921">do you have those communication skills</text><text start="3789.039" dur="5.121">as well</text><text start="3790" dur="6.16">um so i think i whenever i&amp;#39;m</text><text start="3794.16" dur="4">updating things i&amp;#39;ll usually or like if</text><text start="3796.16" dur="3.6">i&amp;#39;m updating my resume for whatever</text><text start="3798.16" dur="2.72">reason i&amp;#39;ll definitely try to add a</text><text start="3799.76" dur="3.279">bullet point</text><text start="3800.88" dur="4.239">that focuses on some of those</text><text start="3803.039" dur="6.401">non-technical skills as well</text><text start="3805.119" dur="6.48">um and the last thing i&amp;#39;ll say too about</text><text start="3809.44" dur="4.08">like data science linkedin bullet points</text><text start="3811.599" dur="3.921">or even bullet points on your resume is</text><text start="3813.52" dur="4.96">like if you</text><text start="3815.52" dur="4.72">are gonna like definitely mention like</text><text start="3818.48" dur="3.52">the different coding languages that you</text><text start="3820.24" dur="3.44">use for a project or the models or</text><text start="3822" dur="3.599">algorithms that you used</text><text start="3823.68" dur="4.08">but if you&amp;#39;re going to mention them</text><text start="3825.599" dur="4.96">there</text><text start="3827.76" dur="4.64">definitely make sure that you can answer</text><text start="3830.559" dur="4.081">a question about them</text><text start="3832.4" dur="4.719">just i&amp;#39;ve been in cases where i&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="3834.64" dur="5.76">interviewed people and they say oh yes i</text><text start="3837.119" dur="5.44">fit this this and this model um</text><text start="3840.4" dur="3.76">definitely make sure you can then ask</text><text start="3842.559" dur="3.601">some questions about like</text><text start="3844.16" dur="3.679">the math behind that model or how you</text><text start="3846.16" dur="4.639">went about doing that</text><text start="3847.839" dur="4.24">so if you&amp;#39;re having bullet points from</text><text start="3850.799" dur="3.441">like earlier projects</text><text start="3852.079" dur="4.161">definitely make sure that you review</text><text start="3854.24" dur="3.839">those kind of so they&amp;#39;re fresh before</text><text start="3856.24" dur="4.079">you go into an interview because</text><text start="3858.079" dur="4.641">we definitely look at linkedin profiles</text><text start="3860.319" dur="2.401">as well</text><text start="3864.24" dur="4.64">and there&amp;#39;s one more question here which</text><text start="3866.24" dur="4.64">is um have you experienced gender bias</text><text start="3868.88" dur="5.439">or microaggressions in your career and</text><text start="3870.88" dur="6.56">how have you navigated that</text><text start="3874.319" dur="6.161">yeah um yeah so i think</text><text start="3877.44" dur="5.52">being a woman in a</text><text start="3880.48" dur="4.319">usually male dominated field this has</text><text start="3882.96" dur="5.119">definitely</text><text start="3884.799" dur="4.961">come up i can think of many</text><text start="3888.079" dur="4.161">kind of different experiences that fall</text><text start="3889.76" dur="4.64">under this but like</text><text start="3892.24" dur="4.4">i think of one example in grad school</text><text start="3894.4" dur="4.32">where kind of just a group working on a</text><text start="3896.64" dur="4">problem set and</text><text start="3898.72" dur="3.52">i shared the correct like oh no we</text><text start="3900.64" dur="2.88">should try this and it turns out being</text><text start="3902.24" dur="3.2">right and</text><text start="3903.52" dur="4.079">myself and my friend were the only ones</text><text start="3905.44" dur="3.2">that were listened to me and then we had</text><text start="3907.599" dur="3.041">a</text><text start="3908.64" dur="3.679">a male student in the group say the same</text><text start="3910.64" dur="2.159">thing 30 minutes later and i was like</text><text start="3912.319" dur="3.76">wait</text><text start="3912.799" dur="5.601">literally i already said that but</text><text start="3916.079" dur="3.28">i think it&amp;#39;s something that is</text><text start="3918.4" dur="4.8">definitely</text><text start="3919.359" dur="7.121">getting better um</text><text start="3923.2" dur="5.599">i think that people now especially with</text><text start="3926.48" dur="6">some of the events that have happened</text><text start="3928.799" dur="6.081">this year are more likely to</text><text start="3932.48" dur="4.96">kind of recognize that okay like people</text><text start="3934.88" dur="4.8">who tend to be minority in spaces like</text><text start="3937.44" dur="4.24">they do get treated differently at times</text><text start="3939.68" dur="4.72">and i don&amp;#39;t even acknowledge when that</text><text start="3941.68" dur="4.879">happens all the time so i think</text><text start="3944.4" dur="4.639">for me one it&amp;#39;s been very helpful to</text><text start="3946.559" dur="2.48">find</text><text start="3949.119" dur="5.761">not support groups but like all</text><text start="3952.319" dur="4.72">like one of my mentors that i have like</text><text start="3954.88" dur="3.52">all often like talk to her about some of</text><text start="3957.039" dur="4.8">this stuff because she&amp;#39;s</text><text start="3958.4" dur="6.719">in a more senior position than me</text><text start="3961.839" dur="4.96">and just like that can even just be</text><text start="3965.119" dur="3.761">helpful in terms of like okay</text><text start="3966.799" dur="3.601">am i crazy like just having some other</text><text start="3968.88" dur="3.439">people to talk about who are also</text><text start="3970.4" dur="5.6">experiencing it is great</text><text start="3972.319" dur="4.561">and then i think two i definitely have</text><text start="3976" dur="4">gotten</text><text start="3976.88" dur="5.199">better at kind of figuring out okay</text><text start="3980" dur="4.4">when something happens okay what&amp;#39;s the</text><text start="3982.079" dur="3.28">best way to address this and like when</text><text start="3984.4" dur="5.439">to bring it up</text><text start="3985.359" dur="6.161">um and i think too like i&amp;#39;ve definitely</text><text start="3989.839" dur="4">it can be uncomfortable at times as well</text><text start="3991.52" dur="3.76">as it&amp;#39;s definitely not easy but i&amp;#39;d say</text><text start="3993.839" dur="2.96">one of the biggest things that i&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="3995.28" dur="4.16">gotten more comfortable</text><text start="3996.799" dur="4.081">with doing than that i would find a lot</text><text start="3999.44" dur="3.84">in meetings at times</text><text start="4000.88" dur="5.679">that i would like be interrupted a lot</text><text start="4003.28" dur="5.92">or like people weren&amp;#39;t really</text><text start="4006.559" dur="3.52">quite like paying as much attention to</text><text start="4009.2" dur="4.72">my points</text><text start="4010.079" dur="5.28">and again like this is not necessarily</text><text start="4013.92" dur="4.24">easy and can be</text><text start="4015.359" dur="4.401">uncomfortable but like if some i got</text><text start="4018.16" dur="1.84">better at okay if someone tries to cut</text><text start="4019.76" dur="2.559">me</text><text start="4020" dur="3.52">off and i&amp;#39;m not done like i&amp;#39;ll just keep</text><text start="4022.319" dur="5.04">talking</text><text start="4023.52" dur="5.92">and then usually they&amp;#39;ll get the hint um</text><text start="4027.359" dur="4.561">i think too also just like identifying</text><text start="4029.44" dur="5.679">people that you can trust within</text><text start="4031.92" dur="4.879">your team as well can be helpful too to</text><text start="4035.119" dur="4.24">kind of have an ally with that</text><text start="4036.799" dur="4.081">it&amp;#39;s like for example in one of my</text><text start="4039.359" dur="5.76">previous roles like</text><text start="4040.88" dur="7.439">i had someone who was male who like</text><text start="4045.119" dur="5.2">in meetings and this was like i</text><text start="4048.319" dur="3.52">didn&amp;#39;t even ask at all but i was like</text><text start="4050.319" dur="2.961">afterwards was like wow thank you i</text><text start="4051.839" dur="3.2">really appreciate that</text><text start="4053.28" dur="3.039">where like if i got interrupted he&amp;#39;d be</text><text start="4055.039" dur="3.28">like well wait</text><text start="4056.319" dur="3.361">megan wasn&amp;#39;t done talking like you need</text><text start="4058.319" dur="4.081">like let&amp;#39;s hear what</text><text start="4059.68" dur="3.52">she has to say um so i think kind of</text><text start="4062.4" dur="2.959">finding</text><text start="4063.2" dur="3.599">just people who you trust that can maybe</text><text start="4065.359" dur="3.68">help you with some of that</text><text start="4066.799" dur="4">but then also recognize that like at</text><text start="4069.039" dur="4.241">some times you might have to have that</text><text start="4070.799" dur="4.481">uncomfortable moment of like</text><text start="4073.28" dur="3.2">being in the meeting and just keeping</text><text start="4075.28" dur="4.16">talking while someone&amp;#39;s</text><text start="4076.48" dur="3.52">interrupted you or another thing that</text><text start="4079.44" dur="2.879">i&amp;#39;ll do</text><text start="4080" dur="4.16">from time to time is like if i say</text><text start="4082.319" dur="3.681">something and then the classic you know</text><text start="4084.16" dur="3.439">someone else repeats it and everyone&amp;#39;s</text><text start="4086" dur="3.2">like oh wow that&amp;#39;s great</text><text start="4087.599" dur="3.2">all done ask oh like can you highlight</text><text start="4089.2" dur="2.24">how that&amp;#39;s different from what i just</text><text start="4090.799" dur="3.841">said</text><text start="4091.44" dur="5.6">um so again it&amp;#39;s not easy</text><text start="4094.64" dur="4.079">um but definitely like try to find that</text><text start="4097.04" dur="4">support system as well</text><text start="4098.719" dur="4.161">so that you can have like a place to</text><text start="4101.04" dur="5.759">vent also about it</text><text start="4102.88" dur="3.919">too because that can be definitely</text><text start="4116.839" dur="3">therapeutic</text><text start="4123.04" dur="6.4">question which is from astato</text><text start="4126.08" dur="5.679">which is sorry if i
