so I&amp;#39;m based in New</text><text start="248.01" dur="3.65">York and I work as a Technical</text><text start="249.239" dur="6.78">Evangelist 4kx</text><text start="251.66" dur="5.889">I&amp;#39;ve worked with the company for I was</text><text start="256.019" dur="3.96">just actually chatting with this work</text><text start="257.549" dur="5.581">company for about five years started as</text><text start="259.979" dur="8.131">a developer and kt+ worked my way up to</text><text start="263.13" dur="6.539">a Solutions Architect left went back to</text><text start="268.11" dur="2.97">college did a master&amp;#39;s in machine</text><text start="269.669" dur="4.5">learning in the University of Edinburgh</text><text start="271.08" dur="5.04">in Scotland which was great and then I</text><text start="274.169" dur="4.321">came back to work in New York as the</text><text start="276.12" dur="4.2">Technical Evangelist so I&amp;#39;ve had a bit</text><text start="278.49" dur="3.78">of a journey kind of in between then</text><text start="280.32" dur="4.07">with the with the company I worked in a</text><text start="282.27" dur="4.92">few different places</text><text start="284.39" dur="4.45">location-wise which was which was fun</text><text start="287.19" dur="3.9">and I&amp;#39;ll actually get into that a little</text><text start="288.84" dur="6.24">bit when I talk about some more about</text><text start="291.09" dur="8.16">tech so the way I&amp;#39;ve approached it today</text><text start="295.08" dur="6.56">I did obviously you know look around and</text><text start="299.25" dur="5.43">I saw that the mission statement for</text><text start="301.64" dur="6.04">data umbrella is to provide a welcoming</text><text start="304.68" dur="6.45">and educational space so really tried to</text><text start="307.68" dur="5.52">focus on putting as much educational</text><text start="311.13" dur="4.05">content as I can in into this</text><text start="313.2" dur="5.279">presentation so I&amp;#39;m hoping to provide a</text><text start="315.18" dur="5.37">very good grounding on you know what is</text><text start="318.479" dur="4.651">KXAS company what does the technology</text><text start="320.55" dur="5.39">look like who uses this what&amp;#39;s the user</text><text start="323.13" dur="4.59">for and then what does that mean for you</text><text start="325.94" dur="4.98">before I jump in</text><text start="327.72" dur="6.21">to the demo and the demonstration will</text><text start="330.92" dur="6.61">do my absolute best to cover as much as</text><text start="333.93" dur="6.9">I possibly can of this language which is</text><text start="337.53" dur="5.16">quite quite broad hello</text><text start="340.83" dur="6.36">so hopefully you&amp;#39;ll come away with a</text><text start="342.69" dur="8.82">very good understanding and knowing</text><text start="347.19" dur="7.02">where to go for more resources so KX is</text><text start="351.51" dur="5.58">a division of first derivatives KX is a</text><text start="354.21" dur="4.62">software company and are the software</text><text start="357.09" dur="6.09">that we produced is a high-performance</text><text start="358.83" dur="6.39">time series database so we&amp;#39;ve actually</text><text start="363.18" dur="6.21">been around for quite a number of years</text><text start="365.22" dur="7.02">now we started in the finance space so</text><text start="369.39" dur="5.22">kind of you know FinTech and really kind</text><text start="372.24" dur="5.31">of focused on the problem of how to deal</text><text start="374.61" dur="4.68">with big data so when people talk about</text><text start="377.55" dur="4.8">big data they tend to kind of split it</text><text start="379.29" dur="6.03">into these Vivi&amp;#39;s so the the four V&amp;#39;s</text><text start="382.35" dur="5.67">there&amp;#39;s a volume velocity variety and</text><text start="385.32" dur="4.71">ferocity is typically the the kind of</text><text start="388.02" dur="4.26">primary for that I think IBM force</text><text start="390.03" dur="4.5">product and if it helps you to think</text><text start="392.28" dur="5.52">about big data in that way</text><text start="394.53" dur="5.25">then you know the place that we work in</text><text start="397.8" dur="5.61">would be the the high volume and high</text><text start="399.78" dur="5.43">velocity space so anywhere where there&amp;#39;s</text><text start="403.41" dur="3.87">huge amounts of data coming after you</text><text start="405.21" dur="4.47">very very quickly is where we were</text><text start="407.28" dur="7.29">typically where our technology is most</text><text start="409.68" dur="8.88">commonly used well we did start in</text><text start="414.57" dur="6.81">finance that&amp;#39;s not that&amp;#39;s not the only</text><text start="418.56" dur="4.98">place we operate now we&amp;#39;ve actually been</text><text start="421.38" dur="4.47">doing a lot of work in other verticals</text><text start="423.54" dur="7.25">so some of the ones that we&amp;#39;ve probably</text><text start="425.85" dur="10.14">gotten the most traction with would be</text><text start="430.79" dur="7.57">IOT and manufacturing so I&amp;#39;ve kind of</text><text start="435.99" dur="4.08">kept the focus on finance for a lot of</text><text start="438.36" dur="4.65">this presentation because it being New</text><text start="440.07" dur="5.849">York certainly for Feroze and the people</text><text start="443.01" dur="5.4">that I work with in this in this place</text><text start="445.919" dur="5.341">and this time zone it tends to be a lot</text><text start="448.41" dur="4.2">of finance related stuff but like I said</text><text start="451.26" dur="2.67">we are kind of working in these other</text><text start="452.61" dur="4.5">verticals and it&amp;#39;s actually really</text><text start="453.93" dur="5.75">interesting to see the the difference on</text><text start="457.11" dur="5.309">the similarity between the datasets so</text><text start="459.68" dur="4.269">if you think about</text><text start="462.419" dur="3.481">the one way in which it will be very</text><text start="463.949" dur="5.761">different from something like IOT or</text><text start="465.9" dur="5.37">manufacturing is the the pickiness of</text><text start="469.71" dur="4.199">the data if that makes sense</text><text start="471.27" dur="4.859">you know if the markets are busy you get</text><text start="473.909" dur="3.741">a very busy day you have very very high</text><text start="476.129" dur="4.741">data volumes</text><text start="477.65" dur="6.04">whereas in IOT or manufacturing you tend</text><text start="480.87" dur="5.729">not to encounter that same distribution</text><text start="483.69" dur="4.92">let&amp;#39;s say of the data the way in which</text><text start="486.599" dur="6.06">they might be very different is that</text><text start="488.61" dur="5.339">with finance you can get downtime you</text><text start="492.659" dur="3.871">know there&amp;#39;s those times when you&amp;#39;re not</text><text start="493.949" dur="3.991">you know so like at weekends the markets</text><text start="496.53" dur="3.99">might not be open</text><text start="497.94" dur="6.449">whereas in IOT or manufacturing it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="500.52" dur="6.84">pretty much 24/7 but they are united in</text><text start="504.389" dur="5.52">that they have tend to have you know</text><text start="507.36" dur="5">huge volumes of data and very fast</text><text start="509.909" dur="4.951">velocities so you&amp;#39;re talking about</text><text start="512.36" dur="4.63">sensor readings every every like</text><text start="514.86" dur="4.08">millisecond coming off multiple multiple</text><text start="516.99" dur="4.729">devices and kind of aggregating that</text><text start="518.94" dur="4.83">together which is not so dissimilar to</text><text start="521.719" dur="4.331">capturing all of the the data from the</text><text start="523.77" dur="6.45">markets and trying to action that in the</text><text start="526.05" dur="7.979">in the finance space so just to lay a</text><text start="530.22" dur="8.73">little bit of the scene the technology</text><text start="534.029" dur="8.661">so anybody who might already be familiar</text><text start="538.95" dur="6">with a little bit the technology will be</text><text start="542.69" dur="8.32">may have heard people refer to it as</text><text start="544.95" dur="8.52">either kt b + kt b or q so this is my</text><text start="551.01" dur="5.13">little infographic you&amp;#39;ll see I&amp;#39;m quite</text><text start="553.47" dur="3.72">fond of pictures to tell to to tell</text><text start="556.14" dur="4.83">stories</text><text start="557.19" dur="6.51">it is this and this to me represents how</text><text start="560.97" dur="5.91">you can think of the software so KD B+</text><text start="563.7" dur="7.259">is the database layer that&amp;#39;s where the</text><text start="566.88" dur="6.09">data is stored on disk and then q is the</text><text start="570.959" dur="3.811">interface around it so that&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="572.97" dur="3.929">turing-complete programming language</text><text start="574.77" dur="5.03">that you use to actually query and</text><text start="576.899" dur="5.611">retrieve the data from the database and</text><text start="579.8" dur="6.43">that&amp;#39;s the language that i&amp;#39;ll be showing</text><text start="582.51" dur="5.28">you in the demo in a moment again more</text><text start="586.23" dur="4.2">effective because pictures tell a</text><text start="587.79" dur="4.44">thousand words I&amp;#39;m gonna break down I</text><text start="590.43" dur="4.29">suppose some of the key features of the</text><text start="592.23" dur="3.21">language and in a way that I hope will</text><text start="594.72" dur="3.06">help</text><text start="595.44" dur="4.26">understand how it might be different to</text><text start="597.78" dur="6.27">or similar to other languages that</text><text start="599.7" dur="8.04">people have worked with before so it&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="604.05" dur="7.17">functional language that means that you</text><text start="607.74" dur="5.76">know there&amp;#39;s no it&amp;#39;s not right compile</text><text start="611.22" dur="5.3">test you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re actually working</text><text start="613.5" dur="5.58">interactively with the data similar to</text><text start="616.52" dur="4.33">Python in that sense and that you&amp;#39;re you</text><text start="619.08" dur="4.41">know you can start with the problem you</text><text start="620.85" dur="4.68">can code around this you can work your</text><text start="623.49" dur="4.08">way through it and it&amp;#39;s certainly I</text><text start="625.53" dur="3.63">spend a lot of my time talking to the</text><text start="627.57" dur="3.21">developers who actually use the language</text><text start="629.16" dur="4.08">and this is one of the things that I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="630.78" dur="4.44">that that they most kind of appreciate</text><text start="633.24" dur="3.9">about it because you know if you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="635.22" dur="4.2">talking about working with big data and</text><text start="637.14" dur="4.47">trying to work through a problem it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="639.42" dur="5.19">actually quite beneficial that the the</text><text start="641.61" dur="4.95">speed of execution is it&amp;#39;s short you</text><text start="644.61" dur="4.71">don&amp;#39;t have to go and take a big tea</text><text start="646.56" dur="5.97">break every time you want to to run some</text><text start="649.32" dur="6.21">code for example it&amp;#39;s a column their</text><text start="652.53" dur="6">base to database so if you&amp;#39;re familiar</text><text start="655.53" dur="5.37">with other databases like MySQL for</text><text start="658.53" dur="3.57">example those are typically although</text><text start="660.9" dur="3.33">it&amp;#39;s becoming more common but they&amp;#39;re</text><text start="662.1" dur="6.09">called new base but those are often row</text><text start="664.23" dur="7.17">based databases the main difference I</text><text start="668.19" dur="4.77">suppose is how the data is retrieved so</text><text start="671.4" dur="3.72">if you&amp;#39;re working with a row base</text><text start="672.96" dur="4.29">database and anytime you want any piece</text><text start="675.12" dur="5.7">of information in that row you have to</text><text start="677.25" dur="5.07">pull the entire row back into memory but</text><text start="680.82" dur="4.11">if you think about big data and how</text><text start="682.32" dur="4.98">people normally work with or use big</text><text start="684.93" dur="4.59">data you&amp;#39;re not you know it&amp;#39;s rare that</text><text start="687.3" dur="4.71">you would say give me all of the data</text><text start="689.52" dur="4.68">often you you&amp;#39;re you know you&amp;#39;re trying</text><text start="692.01" dur="3.45">to filter is you&amp;#39;re trying to work with</text><text start="694.2" dur="3.39">a subset you&amp;#39;re trying to kind of</text><text start="695.46" dur="4.11">aggregate it to all those things so it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="697.59" dur="4.2">very common that you would do something</text><text start="699.57" dur="6.33">like I would like all the data on this</text><text start="701.79" dur="5.88">day&amp;#39;s for the Apple stock for example so</text><text start="705.9" dur="5.61">what they call a new database that means</text><text start="707.67" dur="5.07">you can kind of go to so that you know</text><text start="711.51" dur="4.56">you can go to the particular date that</text><text start="712.74" dur="5.67">you care about you can go to the you</text><text start="716.07" dur="4.89">know the the the stock name and you can</text><text start="718.41" dur="5.28">kind of filter based off of those</text><text start="720.96" dur="4.95">criteria and then only pull back the</text><text start="723.69" dur="4.29">rest of the data for the rows where</text><text start="725.91" dur="3.27">where it&amp;#39;s actually met your filter so</text><text start="727.98" dur="3.3">it&amp;#39;s a much more</text><text start="729.18" dur="6.3">memory efficient way of trying to work</text><text start="731.28" dur="8.61">with these bigger data sets it&amp;#39;s very</text><text start="735.48" dur="7.17">fast and yeah I like to throw this one</text><text start="739.89" dur="5.46">and I upgraded my car from the first</text><text start="742.65"

dur="4.74">to indicate that doesn&amp;#39;t really that</text><text start="766.47" dur="4.61">sounds kind of like a throwaway comment</text><text start="767.67" dur="6.69">at first but I suppose the difference is</text><text start="771.08" dur="6.3">you&amp;#39;re not writing pages and pages pages</text><text start="774.36" dur="6.24">of code to achieve a particular result</text><text start="777.38" dur="7.39">it&amp;#39;s often a case of you might write one</text><text start="780.6" dur="5.19">or two lines and that means that you</text><text start="784.77" dur="2.69">know you you spend more time thinking</text><text start="785.79" dur="4.65">about what it is you&amp;#39;re trying to do and</text><text start="787.46" dur="5.53">when it comes back to you know</text><text start="790.44" dur="4.95">supporting it or actually maintaining</text><text start="792.99" dur="5.1">that code you&amp;#39;re working with a much</text><text start="795.39" dur="5.07">smaller kind of

start="803.7" dur="5.07">people don&amp;#39;t know what this is tables</text><text start="807.24" dur="5.1">are first-order data type in the</text><text start="808.77" dur="6.38">language so it&amp;#39;s a valid statement to</text><text start="812.34" dur="4.92">say table 1 plus table 2 and that will</text><text start="815.15" dur="6.55">depending on what you have in your</text><text start="817.26" dur="6.66">tables work but this is really to</text><text start="821.7" dur="4.68">emphasize the fact that the language and</text><text start="823.92" dur="5.94">the software grew up being focused on</text><text start="826.38" dur="5.16">the problem of data as not just kind of</text><text start="829.86" dur="4.55">a secondary consideration but our the</text><text start="831.54" dur="8">the primary motivation for the software</text><text start="834.41" dur="9.16">so so tables are really frontal entered</text><text start="839.54" dur="5.26">this is time and this is this is really</text><text start="843.57" dur="3.87">a bias</text><text start="844.8" dur="6.18">I suppose the fluidity of it and being</text><text start="847.44" dur="9.63">able to kind of work between different</text><text start="850.98" dur="7.65">times so you know data is is a difficult</text><text start="857.07" dur="4.17">and complicated but but things don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="858.63" dur="4.38">tend not to necessarily coincide a lot</text><text start="861.24" dur="4.289">of the time if we&amp;#39;re talking about fine</text><text start="863.01" dur="6.78">to markets you know like when you get a</text><text start="865.529" dur="7.161">trade you don&amp;#39;t necessarily have a quote</text><text start="869.79" dur="6.989">for that trade at the exact time of that</text><text start="872.69" dur="8.25">trade so you need to do you need to kind</text><text start="876.779" dur="6.781">of recreate the market context by by by</text><text start="880.94" dur="4.42">by retrieving the the quote that was</text><text start="883.56" dur="3.81">present in the market at the time of</text><text start="885.36" dur="4.349">that trade they&amp;#39;ve gotta be very common</text><text start="887.37" dur="4.88">for example for a lot of the people that</text><text start="889.709" dur="5.281">use our software they might use it for</text><text start="892.25" dur="5.529">quality of execution reporting that&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="894.99" dur="5.07">very big one so they&amp;#39;ll they&amp;#39;ll they&amp;#39;ll</text><text start="897.779" dur="5.25">need to know you know did was this the</text><text start="900.06" dur="5.37">best possible trade price that could</text><text start="903.029" dur="5.191">have been achieved have we done the best</text><text start="905.43" dur="4.62">that we possibly could do for our for a</text><text start="908.22" dur="5.419">customer that we&amp;#39;re executing on behalf</text><text start="910.05" dur="6.39">of so there are a number of joins in the</text><text start="913.639" dur="5.681">in the language that are specific to</text><text start="916.44" dur="5.19">time that are based around that I will</text><text start="919.32" dur="5.579">show you the Asif join when we get to</text><text start="921.63" dur="5.97">the demo but I suppose to kind of go the</text><text start="924.899" dur="4.531">more generalized side of things there</text><text start="927.6" dur="4.89">there is a window join in there that</text><text start="929.43" dur="5.04">would let you say for every row that you</text><text start="932.49" dur="5.69">have in one of your tables you can</text><text start="934.47" dur="10.349">define a specific period of time around</text><text start="938.18" dur="8.709">each of those records and join that</text><text start="944.819" dur="5.041">original table with information from</text><text start="946.889" dur="6.45">another table so for example if you had</text><text start="949.86" dur="6.33">a sensor reading you could set a window</text><text start="953.339" dur="5.161">of time maybe you know ten minutes after</text><text start="956.19" dur="3.889">if maybe five minutes before and seven</text><text start="958.5" dur="4.649">minutes after whatever you like and</text><text start="960.079" dur="5.56">retrieve from another table let&amp;#39;s say</text><text start="963.149" dur="5.281">like the temperature that that was</text><text start="965.639" dur="5.161">present in the room at the time for that</text><text start="968.43" dur="5.279">for that sensor during that time period</text><text start="970.8" dur="7.86">so it&amp;#39;s really all about kind of context</text><text start="973.709" dur="8.19">and time is I think the the ultimate</text><text start="978.66" dur="6.21">context without without running the risk</text><text start="981.899" dur="7.68">of sounding fire - um - introspective</text><text start="984.87" dur="8.279">but a but that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the idea when</text><text start="989.579" dur="5.461">doing is the you know bread and butter</text><text start="993.149" dur="3.271">working with big data you know you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="995.04" dur="3.289">you use</text><text start="996.42" dur="6.24">you have so much data you need to</text><text start="998.329" dur="6.31">oftentimes you know work with it and</text><text start="1002.66" dur="4.04">these in these kind of smaller time</text><text start="1004.639" dur="4.44">periods being able to kind of chocolate</text><text start="1006.7" dur="4.03">chop and slice and dice all the data</text><text start="1009.079" dur="6.57">that you&amp;#39;re working with so when doing</text><text start="1010.73" dur="8.219">is important this is about aggregation</text><text start="1015.649" dur="7.291">data aggregation data filtering all of</text><text start="1018.949" dur="4.981">those good things again Big Data so you</text><text start="1022.94" dur="2.19">know if you&amp;#39;re talking about petabytes</text><text start="1023.93" dur="3.09">of data you&amp;#39;re not going to have</text><text start="1025.13" dur="5.27">somebody there looking at it row after</text><text start="1027.02" dur="5.909">row because that&amp;#39;s just not feasible</text><text start="1030.4" dur="4.87">it&amp;#39;s not a good I spend about anybody&amp;#39;s</text><text start="1032.929" dur="4.681">time so it&amp;#39;s all about being able to cut</text><text start="1035.27" dur="4.549">to roll it off into the format that you</text><text start="1037.61" dur="4.559">that you want to see it in the kind of</text><text start="1039.819" dur="4.48">one of the statistics that you care</text><text start="1042.169" dur="4.17">about on the on the subsets of data that</text><text start="1044.299" dur="6.061">you care about and and kind of continue</text><text start="1046.339" dur="6.811">from there so this is actually a little</text><text start="1050.36" dur="4.559">bit of an older reference maybe then</text><text start="1053.15" dur="3.779">then people might be familiar with but</text><text start="1054.919" dur="5.25">this is a lambda here and it refers to</text><text start="1056.929" dur="5.851">kind of the original concept of a lambda</text><text start="1060.169" dur="6.121">architecture so that&amp;#39;s being able to</text><text start="1062.78" dur="7.08">take the the data from very first kind</text><text start="1066.29" dur="5.519">of point of ingest to being able to work</text><text start="1069.86" dur="4.62">with it in real time and then finally</text><text start="1071.809" dur="6">being able to work with it in its wider</text><text start="1074.48"

demo</text><text start="1087.049" dur="6.571">how as a language it allows the</text><text start="1091.52" dur="4.38">flexibility to to do that to work with</text><text start="1093.62" dur="5.67">the

dur="6.06">to to worry about this is it looks like</text><text start="1129.11" dur="3.99">a waterfall it&amp;#39;s supposed to be</text><text start="1130.16" dur="5.9">stream I wanted to highlight the the</text><text start="1133.1" dur="7.02">streaming capabilities because I think</text><text start="1136.06" dur="6.97">for people who already have a good range</text><text start="1140.12" dur="4.68">and breadth of languages as I imagine</text><text start="1143.03" dur="5.73">may well be the case with this with this</text><text start="1144.8" dur="6.54">group of people here it is certainly</text><text start="1148.76" dur="3.9">worth highlighting the the streaming</text><text start="1151.34" dur="4.2">capabilities of the language because I</text><text start="1152.66" dur="7.32">think it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s really a place where</text><text start="1155.54" dur="6.33">we Excel and where maybe there&amp;#39;s not</text><text start="1159.98" dur="6.69">always a great fit with some other</text><text start="1161.87" dur="7.41">languages so I&amp;#39;ve said a few times about</text><text start="1166.67" dur="4.44">how great it is and obviously I would so</text><text start="1169.28" dur="4.08">this is just to say you don&amp;#39;t have to</text><text start="1171.11" dur="5.37">take my word for it and we do</text><text start="1173.36" dur="6.27">participate in benchmarks so to</text><text start="1176.48" dur="4.92">contextualize the benchmarks if you if</text><text start="1179.63" dur="3.54">you recall I was saying that the the</text><text start="1181.4" dur="3.54">that we started in finance so that I</text><text start="1183.17" dur="4.86">suppose as a software we&amp;#39;re a little</text><text start="1184.94" dur="6">over I think we celebrated braided our</text><text start="1188.03" dur="6.33">25 years maybe a few years ago so that</text><text start="1190.94" dur="6.03">whereby we kind of came in to the the</text><text start="1194.36" dur="4.05">market as I suppose high frequency</text><text start="1196.97" dur="5.31">trading and all that stuff was on the</text><text start="1198.41" dur="5.82">rise and the situation that a lot of the</text><text start="1202.28" dur="5.58">financial institutions at the time faced</text><text start="1204.23" dur="6.89">was how do I decide what software to use</text><text start="1207.86" dur="5.61">for this problem that I have and</text><text start="1211.12" dur="4.27">particularly when everyone is going to</text><text start="1213.47" dur="6.42">tell me that their software is the right</text><text start="1215.39" dur="7.29">software to use so stack is a if it&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="1219.89" dur="4.05">group an independent body that kind of</text><text start="1222.68" dur="2.55">sat down with all these financial</text><text start="1223.94" dur="3.18">institutions and said well what do you</text><text start="1225.23" dur="6.21">care about we&amp;#39;ll define appropriate</text><text start="1227.12" dur="7.89">tests to to to track all of these things</text><text start="1231.44" dur="5.61">and then that will help you be able to</text><text start="1235.01" dur="6.24">decide which you know which which</text><text start="1237.05" dur="5.79">software fits your needs the best so for</text><text start="1241.25" dur="6.42">us the ones that we tend to really</text><text start="1242.84" dur="7.62">dominate in and where we I suppose see</text><text start="1247.67" dur="5.25">the most use both in our customers as</text><text start="1250.46" dur="6.66">well is in the in-memory compute and</text><text start="1252.92" dur="7.68">mass of data at rest so I&amp;#39;ve kind of</text><text start="1257.12" dur="7.1">expected so that so that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s just</text><text start="1260.6" dur="3.62">to say you don&amp;#39;t have to just trust me</text><text start="1265.029" dur="4.831">here&amp;#39;s a quick a little

were working on market</text><text start="1324.289" dur="6.571">surveillance so the company chaox we</text><text start="1327.259" dur="6.24">built we brought in a and built a market</text><text

dur="4.171">and talking to the different teams that</text><text start="1449.299" dur="4.171">are based here in New York and and just</text><text start="1451.97" dur="3.389">checking in on them and how they&amp;#39;re how</text><text start="1453.47" dur="2.73">their systems are running and keeping</text><text start="1455.359" dur="6.331">them up-to-date with all the latest</text><text start="1456.2" dur="7.53">features and all that so how is it used</text><text start="1461.69" dur="4.829">I figured I put together a little word</text><text start="1463.73" dur="5.669">cloud to hopefully kind of highlight</text><text start="1466.519" dur="7.98">some of the ways that these clients are</text><text start="1469.399" dur="6.87">using else um so let me see strategy</text><text start="1474.499" dur="4.591">back testing for example would be a very</text><text start="1476.269" dur="4.47">common one for people who are who are</text><text start="1479.09" dur="4.89">using us as a very big historical</text><text start="1480.739" dur="5.07">database so the you know you have</text><text start="1483.98" dur="3.84">petabytes of data you have a new trading</text><text start="1485.809" dur="4.47">strategy but you need to test it before</text><text start="1487.82" dur="5.579">you deploy it so this is that&amp;#39;d be</text><text start="1490.279" dur="6.301">fairly common a lot of analytics around</text><text start="1493.399" dur="5.61">you know a post trade pre-trade quality</text><text start="1496.58" dur="6.15">of execution and just just in general</text><text start="1499.009" dur="9.66">for kind of ad-hoc analysis and and and</text><text start="1502.73" dur="10.169">database to database things so I thought</text><text start="1508.669" dur="8.37">about what you know who all of you are</text><text start="1512.899" dur="6.09">in this audience and what might what</text><text start="1517.039" dur="7.71">might make you interested in learning</text><text start="1518.989" dur="7.53">this software and I suppose the one</text><text start="1524.749" dur="4.8">thing that I would highlight is that it</text><text start="1526.519" dur="3.421">is so frequently used in the investment</text><text start="1529.549" dur="2.191">bank</text><text start="1529.94" dur="3.569">and we have a lot of big hedge fund</text><text start="1531.74" dur="3.84">clients so if you&amp;#39;re somebody who&amp;#39;s</text><text start="1533.509" dur="4.29">looking to try and get more like</text><text start="1535.58" dur="5.549">maneuver into a position where you&amp;#39;re at</text><text start="1537.799" dur="5.911">quant or strat or financial analyst this</text><text start="1541.129" dur="5.371">is a great technology to pick up to try</text><text start="1543.71"

said I find it</text><text start="1552.889" dur="7.5">particularly useful with streaming data</text><text start="1556.45" dur="6.429">and again in terms of the effort being</text><text

then</text><text start="1620.779" dur="6.331">finally I think time the most important</text><text start="1624.59" dur="4.709">well in my opinion the most important</text><text start="1627.11" dur="5.819">resource that that I think we have as</text><text start="1629.299" dur="7.411">people is our time and you know you want</text><text start="1632.929" dur="5.85">to make the most of it so this is this a</text><text start="1636.71" dur="5.04">little infographic I got from four it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="1638.779" dur="4.471">that kind of breaks down what data</text><text

dur="5.85">and try and speed up as much as possible</text><text start="1691.39" dur="4.87">this is this is because I have a forum</text><text start="1694.25" dur="6.21">so this is where I normally

dur="5.94">it&amp;#39;s something that I see a lot and that</text><text start="1705.8" dur="5.1">I think you know whatever software</text><text start="1708.95" dur="5.01">you&amp;#39;re using whatever it is you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="1710.9" dur="5.79">working with you know they&amp;#39;re very kind</text><text start="1713.96" dur="5.16">of good and bad practices and something</text><text start="1716.69" dur="5.37">I see is that people will go to the</text><text start="1719.12" dur="4.32">database it you tend to gathered a lot</text><text start="1722.06" dur="6.24">in these kind of fractured environments</text><text start="1723.44" dur="6.78">so in the top panel here what I see</text><text start="1728.3" dur="3.87">sometimes is that there is a database</text><text start="1730.22" dur="7.14">administration team and then there is</text><text start="1732.17" dur="7.8">the data analytics team and they say</text><text start="1737.36" dur="4.05">maybe you know I mean they talk to each</text><text start="1739.97" dur="5.49">other they&amp;#39;re fine everyone gets along</text><text start="1741.41" dur="6.42">Bush if you want data to use for your</text><text start="1745.46" dur="4.38">data analytics what happens is you get</text><text start="1747.83" dur="3.54">your extract from the database but</text><text start="1749.84" dur="3.18">that&amp;#39;s a database administration team</text><text start="1751.37" dur="4.53">gives to you they put it somewhere on</text><text start="1753.02" dur="5.16">disk and you work with that you work</text><text start="1755.9" dur="6.84">with that extract and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s kind</text><text start="1758.18" dur="6.9">of just what you have but as a data</text><text start="1762.74" dur="6.84">scientist I find that very frustrating</text><text start="1765.08" dur="7.02">because I&amp;#39;ll you know you like to be</text><text start="1769.58" dur="4.32">able to test against other conditions</text><text start="1772.1" dur="3.51">against other edge cases and in other</text><text start="1773.9" dur="4.17">situations so like I might have taken</text><text start="1775.61" dur="4.47">all the information for Apple but now I</text><text start="1778.07" dur="3.56">want to check for Microsoft and now I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="1780.08" dur="2.99">caught in that in a two-week</text><text start="1781.63" dur="5.32">request/response</text><text start="1783.07" dur="6.13">situation and it it it annoys me and</text><text start="1786.95" dur="3.36">also from from a database administration</text><text start="1789.2" dur="4.5">perspective this isn&amp;#39;t great either</text><text start="1790.31" dur="4.65">because you&amp;#39;re you know you&amp;#39;re losing as</text><text start="1793.7" dur="3.48">soon as you take the day that out of the</text><text start="1794.96" dur="4.26">database and you put it somewhere else</text><text start="1797.18" dur="3.81">using data governance you know that that</text><text start="1799.22" dur="2.21">audit trail for who access that data is</text><text start="1800.99" dur="4.59">gone</text><text start="1801.43" dur="7.06">so my recommendation and though it</text><text start="1805.58" dur="4.86">doesn&amp;#39;t have to be our database but you</text><text start="1808.49" dur="4.32">know the best thing you possibly do to</text><text start="1810.44" dur="5.49">really empower people to do the best job</text><text start="1812.81" dur="5.67">they can is to give people that freedom</text><text start="1815.93" dur="6.36">to to work directly with the data and to</text><text start="1818.48" dur="10.08">to be there with it so I will get off my</text><text start="1822.29" dur="8.79">podium now and just move on so I&amp;#39;m aware</text><text start="1828.56" dur="4.5">the audience here is is quite familiar</text><text start="1831.08" dur="4.44">with Python so I wanted to particularly</text><text start="1833.06" dur="5.31">highlight the Python interfaces that we</text><text start="1835.52" dur="4.26">have so we have two and the one that I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="1838.37" dur="2.79">gonna show you in the demo is going to</text><text start="1839.78" dur="3.75">be this one on the left-hand sides that</text><text start="1841.16" dur="4.28">we call embed PI so that&amp;#39;s where it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="1843.53" dur="5.79">kind of what it looks like you&amp;#39;ll see I</text><text start="1845.44" dur="8.23">reuse this pictographic technique of</text><text start="1849.32" dur="6.03">putting putting the thing in but but in</text><text start="1853.67" dur="3.96">fact V that&amp;#39;s what it is it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="1855.35" dur="5.43">cue process that&amp;#39;s running that has a</text><text start="1857.63" dur="4.47">Python process in better than to it so</text><text start="1860.78" dur="4.05">they share the same memory space and</text><text start="1862.1" dur="5.04">it&amp;#39;s really very efficient and then PI Q</text><text start="1864.83" dur="5.01">is the flip side so it&amp;#39;s a Python</text><text start="1867.14" dur="5.04">process that&amp;#39;s got Q embedded in the</text><text start="1869.84" dur="3.93">same memory space so the difference</text><text start="1872.18" dur="2.13">would be the prompt that you&amp;#39;re working</text><text start="1873.77" dur="3.39">with</text><text start="1874.31" dur="5.34">so with embed pi the base language is q</text><text start="1877.16" dur="8.39">and with pi q did they sang we just buy</text><text start="1879.65" dur="5.9">them and that&amp;#39;s the main difference yes</text><text start="1897.13" dur="5.92">yeah that&amp;#39;s a great question and yeah I</text><text start="1901.61" dur="2.97">think that was effectively it I think</text><text start="1903.05" dur="4.74">people got tired of trying to figure out</text><text start="1904.58" dur="5.52">how to how to stitch the data back</text><text start="1907.79" dur="4.47">together to get that context so I I&amp;#39;d</text><text start="1910.1" dur="4.32">mentioned the half of join I&amp;#39;ll show in</text><text start="1912.26" dur="4.86">the demo but the idea is that you can</text><text start="1914.42" dur="6.06">have one table like your tray table and</text><text start="1917.12" dur="5.61">have all of those different times I wish</text><text start="1920.48" dur="4.5">all those trades occurred and you can</text><text start="1922.73" dur="6.36">just say oh give me the quote table as</text><text start="1924.98" dur="5.66">of the time in the tray table now I know</text><text start="1929.09" dur="4.49">there have been</text><text start="1930.64" dur="4.5">that some of these capabilities have</text><text start="1933.58" dur="5.16">been subsequently added to some of these</text><text start="1935.14" dur="5.04">row based ones Bush but that you know</text><text start="1938.74" dur="3.51">performance wise it just wasn&amp;#39;t the same</text><text start="1940.18" dur="5.73">if you&amp;#39;re trying to make a decision</text><text start="1942.25" dur="5.16">about you know how much credit do you</text><text start="1945.91" dur="3.87">want to extend somewhere that&amp;#39;s not</text><text start="1947.41" dur="4.56">something that you really want to to</text><text start="1949.78" dur="3.69">leave waiting for too long you know</text><text start="1951.97" dur="3.36">these are the kinds of things that can</text><text start="1953.47" dur="4.02">recommend uprooting you financially that</text><text start="1955.33" dur="5.88">the time horizon of when you can get</text><text start="1957.49" dur="7.82">those answers and as well at the ability</text><text start="1961.21" dur="7.44">to to to chop up the data and Buckett it</text><text start="1965.31" dur="5.32">appropriately is is also very kind of</text><text start="1968.65" dur="5.79">fundamental to the language as well and</text><text start="1970.63" dur="9.18">I think that that has been one of the</text><text start="1974.44" dur="7.62">real drivers too but yeah it was it was</text><text start="1979.81" dur="5.3">kind of a two-pronged thing it was being</text><text start="1982.06" dur="6.93">able to provide the kind of common</text><text start="1985.11" dur="6.61">analysis techniques that that that that</text><text start="1988.99" dur="5.52">are native in the language now such as</text><text start="1991.72" dur="6.03">the the bidding the aggregating the the</text><text start="1994.51" dur="5.31">time contextualized joins and then also</text><text start="1997.75" dur="4.47">it&amp;#39;s the the speed at which you could</text><text start="1999.82" dur="4.83">perform those operations we&amp;#39;re kind of</text><text start="2002.22" dur="4.02">the two driving factors behind it so how</text><text start="2004.65" dur="4.65">can we do these things firstly and</text><text start="2006.24" dur="6.51">secondly how can we do it at a speed at</text><text start="2009.3" dur="5.67">which this will be valuable you know</text><text start="2012.75" dur="4.8">information still because any</text><text start="2014.97" dur="4.02">information has a has a maybe not maybe</text><text start="2017.55" dur="2.1">not may not all information now that I</text><text start="2018.99" dur="2.34">think about it</text><text start="2019.65" dur="5.07">but a lot of information has a has a</text><text start="2021.33" dur="4.83">finite value horizon and certainly in</text><text start="2024.72" dur="5.64">finance that&amp;#39;s stuff that can be quite</text><text start="2026.16" dur="6.75">Jewish hopefully that answers the</text><text start="2030.36" dur="6.86">question I are there anymore we&amp;#39;re</text><text start="2032.91" dur="4.31">actually well well we&amp;#39;re kind of pause</text><text start="2039.38" dur="7.18">okay okay well hopefully that answers</text><text start="2041.67" dur="7.05">and all continue on yeah so python has</text><text start="2046.56" dur="5.31">been in each place that we&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="2048.72" dur="5.01">particularly focused on because of the</text><text start="2051.87" dur="5.16">huge growth in machine learning and AI</text><text start="2053.73" dur="6.81">we have a team ourselves in London that</text><text start="2057.03" dur="7.44">are exclusively dedicated to machine</text><text start="2060.54" dur="7.97">learning and AI and how how</text><text start="2064.47" dur="7.08">we as a software can you know provide I</text><text start="2068.51" dur="5.74">suppose the most utilities and guidance</text><text start="2071.55" dur="4.52">and and benefit to to the users of our</text><text start="2074.25" dur="4.02">software in that space</text><text start="2076.07" dur="4.829">like I said we&amp;#39;re not planning on</text><text start="2078.27" dur="5.82">rewriting backprop and and really the</text><text start="2080.899" dur="4.901">the most fundamental step I think in in</text><text start="2084.09" dur="4.95">terms of making that available to our</text><text start="2085.8" dur="5.819">customers was you know let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s get</text><text start="2089.04" dur="5.76">an

second</text><text start="2096.45" dur="5.49">that I&amp;#39;m going to use the Jupiter</text><text start="2098.15" dur="5.53">notebook can a format that hopefully a</text><text start="2101.94"

hopefully that&amp;#39;ll arm help you</text><text start="2161.73" dur="6.69">after this if you want to try reproduce</text><text start="2163.5" dur="7.7">some of this so the demo that I&amp;#39;m gonna</text><text start="2168.42" dur="5.91">go through I&amp;#39;m gonna try and give you</text><text start="2171.2" dur="6.22">the biggest whistle software I possibly</text><text start="2174.33" dur="6.72">can of the language so I&amp;#39;m going to show</text><text start="2177.42" dur="5.31">you I suppose the basics of it other as</text><text start="2181.05" dur="4.08">kind of a column based language and</text><text start="2182.73" dur="5.94">really being kind of fact oriented it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="2185.13" dur="6.33">quite like numpy or an umpire whatever</text><text start="2188.67" dur="4.5">way people want to say it and then you</text><text start="2191.46" dur="4.86">know when it comes to the table querying</text><text start="2193.17" dur="4.78">I suppose again with the kind of Python</text><text start="2196.32" dur="4.06">analogy it&amp;#39;s it</text><text start="2197.95" dur="6.84">you know I I actually do a comparison</text><text start="2200.38" dur="7.949">between a query and in pandas versus in</text><text start="2204.79" dur="6.48">in our language we actually have an</text><text start="2208.329" dur="5.661">sql-like syntax that we refer to as cue</text><text start="2211.27" dur="7.92">SQL for for that</text><text start="2213.99" dur="7.21">I&amp;#39;ll show real time so data that like</text><text start="2219.19" dur="5.04">working with data and memory working</text><text start="2221.2" dur="5.25">data on disk and streaming data and then</text><text start="2224.23" dur="5.7">finally the pipe and interoperability so</text><text start="2226.45" dur="5.79">it&amp;#39;s very ambitious but what but</text><text start="2229.93" dur="8.76">hopefully it&amp;#39;ll be a good introduction</text><text start="2232.24" dur="8.49">so I was saying that it&amp;#39;s like numpy it</text><text start="2238.69" dur="4.369">is it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s very much vector based so</text><text start="2240.73" dur="7.319">in this cell here all I&amp;#39;m doing is</text><text start="2243.059" dur="6.431">creating a vector or an array that I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="2248.049" dur="2.76">calling a and then I&amp;#39;m just adding 10</text><text start="2249.49" dur="6.15">and you can see that all the operations</text><text start="2250.809" dur="8.671">are are kind of pairwise out of the out</text><text start="2255.64" dur="6.15">of the box in this case I&amp;#39;m taking the</text><text start="2259.48" dur="3.66">the kind of the vector B and the vector</text><text start="2261.79" dur="3.21">a and I&amp;#39;m adding them together and</text><text start="2263.14" dur="5.219">that&amp;#39;s just kind of automatically</text><text start="2265" dur="8.4">working pairwise so that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s pretty</text><text start="2268.359" dur="7.651">neat and useful in a lot of ways but</text><text start="2273.4" dur="5.63">moving on actually getting our hands on</text><text start="2276.01" dur="6.45">some data I have pre-loaded some</text><text start="2279.03" dur="5.049">simulated trade and quote data so this</text><text start="2282.46" dur="4.2">is what my quote table looks like I&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="2284.079" dur="4.76">got my symbols the time and the</text><text start="2286.66" dur="5.78">standards kind of quote information and</text><text start="2288.839" dur="5.801">similarly I have my my trades they&amp;#39;re a</text><text start="2292.44" dur="3.429">paradigm version because we don&amp;#39;t we</text><text start="2294.64" dur="4.469">don&amp;#39;t

million in</text><text start="2302.339" dur="6.97">quotes and 1 million in trades I also</text><text start="2306.45" dur="6.34">because I&amp;#39;m running this with embed pie</text><text start="2309.309" dur="5.79">I&amp;#39;ve also got that same data in Python</text><text start="2312.79" dur="4.259">so that I can hopefully show a little</text><text start="2315.099" dur="3.72">bit of the the kind of side-by-side</text><text start="2317.049" dur="5.81">direct comparisons so just to prove</text><text start="2318.819" dur="4.04">they&amp;#39;re the same here we go</text><text start="2322.89" dur="4.6">the good thing is because we&amp;#39;re working</text><text start="2325.48" dur="4.829">in this Jupiter notebook environment we</text><text start="2327.49" dur="4.38">can actually we can run some cells and</text><text start="2330.309" dur="3.211">you in some cells and Python</text><text start="2331.87" dur="4.98">by using these neat little magic</text><text start="2333.52" dur="7.29">commands so I&amp;#39;m going to recreate a very</text><text start="2336.85" dur="7.47">common requirement for for financial</text><text start="2340.81" dur="5.7">data which is to create a volume</text><text start="2344.32" dur="5.37">weighted average price referred to as a</text><text start="2346.51" dur="5.31">via broken down for each of my different</text><text

for some for some</text><text start="2356.02" dur="5.21">different models so if I do that in</text><text start="2358.78" dur="6.12">Python you can see it looks like this</text><text start="2361.23" dur="6.06">now obviously I&amp;#39;m very aware I&amp;#39;m talking</text><text start="2364.9" dur="7.52">to a group of people who are quite</text><text start="2367.29" dur="7.21">Python litoris so any suggestions on on</text><text start="2372.42" dur="5.14">refactoring this are very welcome but</text><text start="2374.5" dur="6.48">this was this was my attempt at doing</text><text start="2377.56" dur="9.17">this in in panas and here is the</text><text start="2380.98" dur="9.69">equivalent in NQ so you can see the</text><text start="2386.73" dur="6.67">sql-like syntax so select the columns</text><text start="2390.67" dur="4.47">for caribou ish broken down by the</text><text start="2393.4" dur="6">columns we want to break down by from</text><text start="2395.14"

key</text><text start="2403.21" dur="4.98">words and the language so they kind of</text><text start="2405.1" dur="4.11">do as you as you would expect I don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="2408.19" dur="3.54">think there&amp;#39;s anything here that I</text><text start="2409.21" dur="4.29">thought that people are struggling with</text><text start="2411.73" dur="7.14">but it&amp;#39;s any questions do you just</text><text start="2413.5" dur="7.04">change wabg is weighted average so yeah</text><text start="2418.87" dur="4.44">so it&amp;#39;s very easy to kind of get that</text><text start="2420.54" dur="6.25">same breakdown and just to prove that</text><text start="2423.31" dur="5.01">those are the same and a more</text><text start="2426.79" dur="4.56">complicated thing that I didn&amp;#39;t even</text><text start="2428.32" dur="4.59">honestly attempt to do in Python but it</text><text start="2431.35" dur="4.11">but if somebody knows this please do</text><text start="2432.91" dur="4.52">semi on the code is a time weighted</text><text start="2435.46" dur="4.8">average price so this is where we search</text><text start="2437.43" dur="4.75">to kind of again just highlight that</text><text start="2440.26" dur="4.29">area earlier questions that somebody had</text><text start="2442.18" dur="4.92">like why why was through the need for</text><text start="2444.55" dur="4.8">this this is an example of something</text><text start="2447.1" dur="5.22">that be very common to do that&amp;#39;s using</text><text start="2449.35" dur="7.02">time that maybe isn&amp;#39;t as easy to do in</text><text start="2452.32" dur="7.52">other languages so what we&amp;#39;re getting or</text><text start="2456.37" dur="6.48">generating here is a time weighted well</text><text start="2459.84" dur="4.78">this is actually a spread but it could</text><text start="2462.85" dur="2.969">be it could be on thing is but its time</text><text start="2464.62" dur="4.079">weighted and it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="2465.819" dur="4.92">and I&amp;#39;m buy buy stock and here&amp;#39;s an</text><text start="2468.699" dur="5.33">example of some of the aggregations so</text><text start="2470.739" dur="6">this X bar function here is actually</text><text start="2474.029" dur="4.42">performing pocketing so it&amp;#39;s breaking</text><text start="2476.739" dur="4.23">out all the times in two 30-minute</text><text start="2478.449" dur="8.52">buckets and then this is the the time</text><text start="2480.969" dur="10.5">weighted average spread so so hopefully</text><text start="2486.969" dur="7.411">that helps to kind of highlight or make</text><text start="2491.469" dur="6.75">it clear how kind of time focused the</text><text start="2494.38" dur="5.699">the language in the syntax is but we do</text><text start="2498.219" dur="4.711">have the the standard joints that you&amp;#39;d</text><text start="2500.079" dur="5.91">expect so if we do have this kind of</text><text start="2502.93" dur="4.98">reference table like this info is just</text><text start="2505.989" dur="4.171">giving us the full company names we can</text><text start="2507.91" dur="5.909">use a left join and append that</text><text start="2510.16" dur="7.589">information on but more interestingly we</text><text start="2513.819" dur="6.51">have this out of join so let me show you</text><text start="2517.749" dur="5.31">what this looks like what I&amp;#39;m doing here</text><text start="2520.329" dur="6.87">is I&amp;#39;m joining the trade table with the</text><text start="2523.059" dur="6.03">quote table and I&amp;#39;m doing it where this</text><text start="2527.199" dur="4.05">symbol is match exactly so if I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="2529.089" dur="5.43">looking at a trade and Apple I only care</text><text start="2531.249" dur="5.191">about quotes and Apple and then my time</text><text start="2534.519" dur="4.29">column is gonna serve as like a soft</text><text start="2536.44" dur="5.7">lookup so I&amp;#39;ll see if I can find an</text><text start="2538.809" dur="8.43">example here in the in the in the like</text><text start="2542.14" dur="7.649">directly in the things okay so if for</text><text start="2547.239" dur="5.641">example here there was a trade that</text><text start="2549.789" dur="9.06">happened in Apple at mine 30 and then</text><text start="2552.88" dur="7.349">all of these milliseconds later actually</text><text start="2558.849" dur="3.301">that&amp;#39;s another thing that we have native</text><text start="2560.229" dur="3.6">to the language that maybe not a lot of</text><text start="2562.15" dur="4.859">other databases support it&amp;#39;s just the</text><text start="2563.829" dur="4.95">granularity of time that we support but</text><text start="2567.009" dur="3.57">yes so it happened at this time and</text><text start="2568.779" dur="4.8">you&amp;#39;ll see that this quote information</text><text start="2570.579" dur="7.28">that has been joined on is actually from</text><text start="2573.579" dur="9.571">a quote that occurred just like that one</text><text start="2577.859" dur="6.85">one increment beforehand so while this</text><text start="2583.15" dur="3.839">was obviously very close in time that</text><text start="2584.709" dur="3.57">could be much much earlier in the day if</text><text start="2586.989" dur="4.921">you&amp;#39;re looking at something that&amp;#39;s maybe</text><text start="2588.279" dur="5.04">particularly illiquid and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="2591.91" dur="3.209">kind of the idea behind us being able to</text><text start="2593.319" dur="4.371">kind of bring that context in and say</text><text start="2595.119" dur="4.771">well this was the quote and therefore</text><text start="2597.69" dur="7.809">therefore this this works like that</text><text start="2599.89" dur="7.02">so just to show the tables the benefit</text><text start="2605.499" dur="2.971">of being able to do this kind of</text><text start="2606.91" dur="6.209">analysis so now that I&amp;#39;ve made this</text><text start="2608.47" dur="7.5">table tack that has my contextualized</text><text start="2613.119" dur="4.98">trade data I can use that to perform</text><text start="2615.97" dur="4.71">different analysis so like like I said a</text><text start="2618.099" dur="5.131">very common one is around the quality of</text><text start="2620.68" dur="5.909">execution so I&amp;#39;m gonna go and I&amp;#39;m gonna</text><text start="2623.23" dur="5.129">pull out all the cases where where that</text><text start="2626.589" dur="3.571">price that I traded out wasn&amp;#39;t within</text><text start="2628.359" dur="5.25">the better ask so this is something</text><text start="2630.16" dur="6.149">unusual that really should be justified</text><text start="2633.609" dur="4.38">because you know if if they die the</text><text start="2636.309" dur="4.141">better ask it you know there&amp;#39;s a very</text><text start="2637.989" dur="4.171">good chance that this wasn&amp;#39;t optimal in</text><text start="2640.45" dur="5.52">terms of its execution so that needs to</text><text start="2642.16" dur="5.879">be addressed for the clients the neat</text><text start="2645.97" dur="5.25">thing about it being a programming</text><text start="2648.039" dur="6.21">language is that you can put code kind</text><text start="2651.22" dur="5.339">of directly into your break downs so if</text><text start="2654.249" dur="4.59">you&amp;#39;re used tool maybe some other</text><text start="2656.559" dur="4.5">languages you know that the break downs</text><text start="2658.839" dur="3.631">often have to be kind of existing</text><text start="2661.059" dur="4.05">columns so this would be maybe a</text><text start="2662.47" dur="6.21">two-step process you&amp;#39;d have to make the</text><text start="2665.109" dur="5.031">column and then break down then do your</text><text start="2668.68" dur="4.5">break down on the kind of the next line</text><text start="2670.14" dur="4.929">working with a new table but because</text><text start="2673.18" dur="4.559">it&amp;#39;s a full programming language you can</text><text start="2675.069" dur="5.371">put kind of whatever you you want in</text><text start="2677.739" dur="6.56">here to kind of get your breakdowns so</text><text start="2680.44" dur="6.839">here I&amp;#39;m deciding if it was a valid</text><text start="2684.299" dur="5.141">trade or not by deciding by checking if</text><text start="2687.279" dur="6.48">the price was within that bidder asked</text><text start="2689.44" dur="6.839">from the quotes so these cases here</text><text start="2693.759" dur="4.35">where it&amp;#39;s zero this is a booty in value</text><text start="2696.279" dur="6.81">are telling me that that&amp;#39;s not true</text><text start="2698.109" dur="6.871">so there was 84 cases where trades</text><text start="2703.089" dur="5.821">happens that were excited by the quote</text><text start="2704.98" dur="8.119">in this in this stock so that is where</text><text start="2708.91" dur="8.22">if I&amp;#39;m the person charged with you know</text><text start="2713.099" dur="7.9">ensuring quality execution that&amp;#39;s where</text><text start="2717.13" dur="8.82">I would be starting to to look as my</text><text start="2720.999" dur="6.901">kind of basis so this was a quick</text><text start="2725.95" dur="4.319">example of the syntax I was working with</text><text start="2727.9" dur="5.939">in-memory data but now we&amp;#39;re going to</text><text start="2730.269" dur="5.82">jump to on disk data so I have</text><text start="2733.839" dur="4.341">much bigger tables on disk now having</text><text

start="2983.56" dur="4.02">will I will go back in for free ease of</text><text start="2985.42" dur="5.25">readability now but just a highlight</text><text start="2987.58" dur="6.39">that this is less

a yep I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="3168.759" dur="5.121">gonna start in a tangent there stuff but</text><text start="3171.789" dur="5.24">yeah we should chat about us</text><text start="3173.88" dur="7.3">so yeah finally moving on to streaming</text><text start="3177.029" dur="6.82">so you we&amp;#39;ve already looked at this and</text><text start="3181.18" dur="5.909">I had the the five million quote 1</text><text start="3183.849" dur="6">million at trade so I can do you know</text><text start="3187.089" dur="4.44">the syntax that you saw before but what</text><text start="3189.849" dur="5.85">I&amp;#39;m going to do now is I&amp;#39;m going to</text><text start="3191.529" dur="6.21">subscribe to some data in on the back</text><text start="3195.699" dur="5.971">end and you&amp;#39;ll see that this is now</text><text start="3197.739" dur="6.27">changing the number of rows I have in my</text><text start="3201.67" dur="7.589">data is is changing as I get new data in</text><text start="3204.009" dur="7.35">to the system so I can still work with</text><text start="3209.259" dur="4.19">that live data even though it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="3211.359" dur="6.031">streaming and calculate these kind of</text><text start="3213.449" dur="5.681">metrics on the fly so I think that my</text><text start="3217.39" dur="4.829">total count broken down by each stock</text><text start="3219.13" dur="5.819">from my cool table and you can see that</text><text start="3222.219" dur="5.31">those aren&amp;#39;t changing this is where I</text><text start="3224.949" dur="4.56">normally go into my architect mode and</text><text start="3227.529" dur="3.27">talk a little bit about it good system</text><text start="3229.509" dur="6.98">design</text><text start="3230.799" dur="5.69">so there&amp;#39;s a very big difference between</text><text start="3236.67" dur="7.869">streaming analytics and kind of these ad</text><text start="3240.009" dur="8">hoc api&amp;#39;s when it comes to what effect</text><text start="3244.539" dur="6.361">it has on the system so I&amp;#39;ll try clarify</text><text start="3248.009" dur="5.651">the quote table here that we have is</text><text start="3250.9" dur="4.559">going to be increasing as the day goes</text><text start="3253.66" dur="4.079">on so every time you get a new set of</text><text start="3255.459" dur="3.75">data that&amp;#39;s appended on to the end of</text><text start="3257.739" dur="2.011">your code table and that continues to</text><text start="3259.209" dur="2.371">grow</text><text start="3259.75" dur="4.56">so that means that when you&amp;#39;re running</text><text start="3261.58" dur="4.5">this query that&amp;#39;s going to take</text><text

obviously it&amp;#39;s a very fast very</text><text start="3270.01" dur="4.8">performant language like you know this</text><text start="3271.48" dur="5.52">doesn&amp;#39;t take really any time to do if</text><text start="3274.81" dur="5.19">you have a lot of people working on the</text><text start="3277" dur="6.78">same system and I&amp;#39;m wanting to kind of</text><text start="3280" dur="8.52">do these queries then you know that can</text><text start="3283.78" dur="7.05">sometimes become non significant and you</text><text start="3288.52" dur="3.51">don&amp;#39;t like that if you if you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="3290.83" dur="3.9">designing systems you don&amp;#39;t like</text><text start="3292.03" dur="5.88">unknowns you don&amp;#39;t like not being able</text><text start="3294.73" dur="8.1">to you know have things behave in a very</text><text start="3297.91" dur="7.56">expected way so what we do in the</text><text start="3302.83" dur="5.73">Connecticut EQ world is we we use</text><text start="3305.47" dur="6.45">streaming analytics so streaming</text><text start="3308.56" dur="5.309">analytics are really just getting to</text><text start="3311.92" dur="4.86">decide what you want to do with each bit</text><text start="3313.869" dur="6.391">of information you get so if I get a new</text><text start="3316.78" dur="5.25">a new quote message what I&amp;#39;m going to</text><text start="3320.26" dur="5.19">get I&amp;#39;m going to get a little mini table</text><text start="3322.03" dur="6">that will have some amount of quotes so</text><text start="3325.45" dur="4.8">that could be one row or it could be</text><text start="3328.03" dur="6.96">many many rows it depends on kind of the</text><text start="3330.25" dur="7.52">upstream system but I decide what I want</text><text start="3334.99" dur="6.18">to do every time I get that message so</text><text start="3337.77" dur="5.71">that means that well actually I&amp;#39;ll just</text><text start="3341.17" dur="3.96">show you here so I&amp;#39;m gonna make a new</text><text start="3343.48" dur="3.65">streaming function and it&amp;#39;s going to</text><text start="3345.13" dur="4.709">happen every time I get a quote message</text><text start="3347.13" dur="7.54">so this here the curly brackets are the</text><text start="3349.839" dur="8.25">is how you write a function in in in k2</text><text start="3354.67" dur="5.1">b /q and then this here is that the</text><text start="3358.089" dur="3.241">parameter so I&amp;#39;m saying that this is a</text><text start="3359.77" dur="3.089">function that takes a parameter Q and</text><text start="3361.33" dur="3.96">then I&amp;#39;m writing the code for what I</text><text start="3362.859" dur="5.581">wanted to do so I&amp;#39;m gonna create a new</text><text start="3365.29" dur="5.67">table called Q total that&amp;#39;s going to for</text><text start="3368.44" dur="5.28">every kind of

dur="6.42">just that message so that could be like</text><text start="3384.13" dur="6.33">three Microsoft messages and one Oracle</text><text start="3388.06" dur="5.05">and to IBM that might be what came in in</text><text start="3390.46" dur="5.71">a bundle and I&amp;#39;m going to them</text><text start="3393.11" dur="5.34">add that on so this is an example of</text><text start="3396.17" dur="3.51">kind of adding two tables really but</text><text start="3398.45" dur="2.94">that I kind of talked about before I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="3399.68" dur="4.05">going to add that on to this Q total</text><text start="3401.39" dur="7.62">table so that every time I get a new</text><text start="3403.73" dur="8.04">message this is updated so the benefit</text><text start="3409.01" dur="4.92">of doing that just to show those two</text><text start="3411.77" dur="5.49">things are the same now and they will</text><text start="3413.93" dur="5.34">continue to be the same is that

start="3442.31" dur="6.42">process that&amp;#39;s you know this is this is</text><text start="3445.55" dur="4.44">this is going to take take the same</text><text start="3448.73" dur="3.06">amout of time no matter what time of the</text><text start="3449.99" dur="4.53">day they put this in as opposed to the</text><text start="3451.79" dur="4.41">first query which will have you know</text><text

start="3469.43" dur="4.8">discrete fashion and it does mean that</text><text start="3472.13" dur="3.96">then you can that this is kind of a</text><text start="3474.23" dur="5.28">whole framework that

start="3530.75" dur="4.74">harder than others</text><text start="3531.65" dur="5.76">but but it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s really very</text><text start="3535.49" dur="6.72">powerful to be able to work with things</text><text start="3537.41" dur="6.48">incrementally so if you&amp;#39;re interested at</text><text start="3542.21" dur="4.5">all in kind of capturing real-time data</text><text start="3543.89" dur="5.79">and maybe driving analytics or decisions</text><text start="3546.71" dur="5.639">off of it you know I it is very fun to</text><text start="3549.68" dur="4.889">play with and it&amp;#39;s pretty easy to kind</text><text start="3552.349" dur="5.94">of set up different different</text><text start="3554.569" dur="6.061">connections the audience being what it</text><text start="3558.289" dur="3.99">is I thought I&amp;#39;d also show some Python</text><text start="3560.63" dur="3.889">integration because we because we all</text><text start="3562.279" dur="4.921">feel like typed on here so that&amp;#39;s great</text><text start="3564.519" dur="4.151">so I&amp;#39;m gonna build a time series this is</text><text start="3567.2" dur="3.48">a little bit more complicated than the</text><text start="3568.67" dur="3.72">one I did before so rather than getting</text><text start="3570.68" dur="5.099">just the end of day price from my</text><text start="3572.39" dur="5.25">historical trades table for e or my</text><text start="3575.779" dur="4.05">volume way to price over the day for</text><text start="3577.64" dur="3.899">each day I&amp;#39;m getting an even more</text><text start="3579.829" dur="4.97">granular time series I&amp;#39;m going to get</text><text start="3581.539" dur="6.74">the the kind of opening price in</text><text start="3584.799" dur="6.341">15-minute time buckets for each stock</text><text start="3588.279" dur="7.391">across all the days in my in my database</text><text start="3591.14" dur="7.189">so this is built a 15-minute bucketed</text><text start="3595.67" dur="6.419">time series for for each of my stocks</text><text start="3598.329" dur="8.141">and then I can import map Bartlett</text><text start="3602.089" dur="6">so this dot k dot import is is is is</text><text start="3606.47" dur="3.299">doing that so I&amp;#39;m just saying got PETA</text><text start="3608.089" dur="5.94">in Porsche whatever the library is I</text><text start="3609.769" dur="5.881">want from from Python and if I I&amp;#39;ll show</text><text start="3614.029" dur="6.691">you it that looks like that just as that</text><text start="3615.65" dur="9.24">it&amp;#39;s this module here and then I can use</text><text start="3620.72" dur="7.289">this kind of a syntax to to to to to use</text><text start="3624.89" dur="4.679">it so I&amp;#39;m saying I want to go into plush</text><text start="3628.009" dur="6.421">on the function I care about it is ass</text><text start="3629.569" dur="6.571">bigger and then this key wipe aw is</text><text start="3634.43" dur="3.3">saying it&amp;#39;s a Python keyword and I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="3636.14" dur="4.59">saying that associate the Python keyword</text><text start="3637.73" dur="9.5">of big size with with this input so I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="3640.73" dur="10.23">kind of meshing the the Q the Q</text><text start="3647.23" dur="6.52">variables into the in but leveraging the</text><text start="3650.96" dur="6.899">Python library and then I just extract</text><text start="3653.75" dur="6.44">the time series for Adele and I plot my</text><text start="3657.859" dur="4.551">my</text><text start="3660.19" dur="4.409">my figure so that&amp;#39;s obviously pretty</text><text start="3662.41" dur="5.459">straightforward the nice thing about</text><text start="3664.599" dur="5.341">this is that I can then use the very Q</text><text start="3667.869" dur="5.011">like syntax of of wrapping things up in</text><text start="3669.94" dur="5.31">functions and iterating to to kind of go</text><text start="3672.88" dur="5.67">a little bit further so I start with</text><text start="3675.25" dur="5.64">making my my um my kind of basic plot</text><text start="3678.55" dur="5.64">said I&amp;#39;d the the size and all last and</text><text start="3680.89" dur="6.36">then I wrap all of this into a pipe into</text><text start="3684.19" dur="6.84">into a little function so this is going</text><text start="3687.25" dur="5.46">to take each of my time series and like</text><text start="3691.03" dur="4.2">I said they&amp;#39;re at dictionary so I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="3692.71" dur="5.31">pulling out the I&amp;#39;m pulling out the</text><text start="3695.23" dur="6.839">price and I&amp;#39;m pulling out the the symbol</text><text start="3698.02" dur="7.349">for for each of my sorry for each of my</text><text start="3702.069" dur="6.961">rows of my of my table and plot them</text><text start="3705.369" dur="7.141">kind of all at once so that&amp;#39;s the this</text><text start="3709.03" dur="7.86">this each year is the is is another</text><text start="3712.51" dur="7.14">iterator in in in in KDB so it&amp;#39;ll take</text><text start="3716.89" dur="6.06">any function and it will apply it to</text><text start="3719.65" dur="7.07">each of these and this time series here</text><text start="3722.95" dur="6.659">is the the table of above where I&amp;#39;ve got</text><text start="3726.72" dur="5.41">this sim and the price for each of the</text><text start="3729.609" dur="5.49">different rows that and they&amp;#39;re those</text><text start="3732.13" dur="6.3">basically get passed through as a kind</text><text start="3735.099" dur="5.961">of a dictionary structure into into this</text><text start="3738.43" dur="6.63">and in the new pod them all so that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="3741.06" dur="8.62">that&amp;#39;s a very quick with a subtour the</text><text start="3745.06" dur="10.98">of the technology I&amp;#39;ll flick back to</text><text start="3749.68" dur="9.149">slides now if I
