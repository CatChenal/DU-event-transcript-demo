GIT you're not familiar with it is a version control system and the reason you need this is twofold one again just sort of practically it's something that's very useful in the job because what it allows you to do is rather if you've ever uh like saved you know word files and you've been like draft one, draft two draft three, draft ten because you wanted those old versions in case you needed something from them GIT basically does this for you so rather than saving every time you commit it gives a snapshot of what your code", "looked like at that time so if you ever need to go back to it you can there's a bunch of other benefits as well but the second big one is it's a great collaboration tool so GitHub is one of the places you can host your code that you've saved with GIT and it's a way that many open source", "projects are done through GitHub that's how you can contribute code or file issues, uh if you're working on a data science team that's how you could collaborate on a project so this is the third fundamental thing you need to know on the programming side. And I'll add here at the end a lot of", "people ask like well what should I learn R or Python? This is a tough question my first advice is Python is generally more common to see in job descriptions so if you just want to go off like what's the most likely thing I'll have it's probably Python but R is more common in certain types of positions so sometimes more analytics positions or people coming from academia so it's worth it if you have an idea of what industry you want to work in. In data science or what type of data science job to take a look at those job descriptions and see do they say R do they say Python do they say both and if it seems like ah it's kind of like either or some of it is Python some of it is R you know I would try out both of them and see what you like better but I would definitely focus at the beginning on just getting good at one of them rather than trying to get to a medium level in both.", "", "", "### Slide 15: Mathematics and Statistics (8:17)", "<a href=\"https://youtu.be/HsFFuFYz7zE?t=278\"><img src=\"images/emily_robinson_career/erc_s14.png\" width=\"50%\" /></a>", "", "All right so mathematics and statistics, I'm going to break this down into a couple of parts the first is knowing what techniques exist so for example if you're working at a company and they say hey I need to group customers together you need to know that oh I should try clustering that's a mathematical method that can make groups from this data well then you need to know how to apply them so how do you actually do a k-means clustering for example in R of Python but finally how do you", "choose which to try so there are many clustering methods and rather than trying each one of them you know if you know something about the technique if you know that what cases they work well and what they don't work well in you can narrow down pretty quickly and figure out you know what technique", "should I try and also some of the intricacies of do I have to normalize my data beforehand you know", "all these other things of understanding a bit under the hood how it works.", "", "", "### Slide 16: Mathematics and Statistics (9:03)", "<a href=\"https://youtu.be/HsFFuFYz7zE?t=543\"><img src=\"images/emily_robinson_career/erc_s15.png\" width=\"50%\" /></a>", "", "Finally domain knowledge so i'm going to take this diagram from Renee Teate on to describe domain knowledge which is a core job of most data scientists is to take a business question for example how can we split our customers into different groups to market to and turn that into a data science question so in this case like the example I gave before how can we run a clustering algorithm to", "segment customer data? Then you need to get the data science answer so for example your clustering", "found three distinct groups but you can't stop there, because that's not very helpful to the business what they want to hear is something like hey here are three types of customers, new, high spending and commercial, for if you've been working for example with kaggle competitions they start at the data science question right they start with here is a data set you know predict this thing um but most the time you're not going to get something so clear-cut and you're going to have to work with the business stakeholder to try to figure out what are they actually trying to answer what are they looking for and things you need to do that successfully include good communication skills, empathy, and understanding your data which is huge so for example where where can you find your data what are some assumptions what are some edge cases and this is where you'll probably see a lot of tweets about working with messy data this is exactly about that because in the real world uh just data comes with so much mess you don't know if you should go and try to find another data set?

he saw yes in fact the Android does have you know more words that are on the sadness scale or fear anger and this actually was picked up um by some news uh outlets and so what he actually did before the sentiment is he also showed look the pattern of the android and the iPhone's tweets these are clearly different like how they quote tweet, when they tweet, so on it definitely looks like these are different people and we have seen Trump tweeting on his Android so the other one must be the campaign staff so in this case there was a question and so Dave went out and got used the Twitter API to

question you have about a data set maybe say hey I'm gonna try to answer this one question or I'm gonna try to make this one visualization or I'm you know I want to do this project because I'll need

you tackle so I just", "listened to the super data science podcast with uh Krill and he said he divides it as a data analyst is determining the exact term it's basically doing like descriptive analytics about the past what's happened before and a data scientist is doing predictive what's going to happen and some uh also some analysis of what would be prescriptive what should we do based on that so that's another way so there's all these different ways to divide it and the other problem is what it means that companies vary so much so there's a good blog post from Lyft about how they changed all of their data analysts to be data scientists and their data scientists to be research scientists two years ago Etsy where I used to work did a similar thing whereas previously the data analyst team we were working we were using R and Python and stats and you know doing some uh you know even some machine learning but we were embedded with uh um you know sort of uh other teams and basically we said we did data for data science for human consumption the data scientist team was about working on the ad algorithms or the search ranking algorithms so they did data science for machine consumption but then since I left they changed their title to data scientists so really it's so different from out from company to company but in terms of looking at positions with a data analyst what I would look out for is finding a position where you can use R or Python and there's some also you know some like stats or math or something that you can do in there um as well but really just studying it but on the other hand you know if you've never worked with data before maybe you just want to start out with like you know I just want to start working with data it's okay if it's in

so you won't know everything anymore so that's one of the reasons I think it's so", "common and what uh Caitlyn says she does to deal with this is just like try to remember like you know what what she does know so accepting that you can't know everything but that's okay but I do know things other people don't like i've built these predictive models i've you know uh you know learned to do machine learning models in production like remember what you do know and how valuable that is so that's been some helpful for me but I think the other thing honestly is having a community that will help support you um so I've you know I've had people I mentioned a little bit about working at Metis there are some random people on the internet mostly on Reddit where you don't have your real name who are like a bootcamp graduate can never be a real data scientist essentially", "like as bootcamp education just can't be and you know I I want hopefully some point I'll get the point where like I can just be like nope you know I'm secure in myself I you know will not this doesn't bother me at all but it did bother me but one thing that helped was like talking to other data scientists that I know um and that really helped me is like yes there's some internal work you need to do but also there is something nice like turning to friends turning to former colleagues who are like what are you kidding you you did great work on that project like you did all these things like you're so valuable so that at least has helped me because the community also reminds you when you talk to these people when you get to know like that data scientist at AirBnB or like these other things you admire you gotta know oh wait they don't they don't know everything either you know they also have doubts they are people too and I think that can really help uh break down this image of some of these folks on Twitter that they always feel confident that they know everything that no one ever criticizes them because when you get to know them you're like hey no these are actually people", "that I can relate to on a personal level.", "", "Great thanks so one person asked three questions but I do want to give other people a chance so I'll come back to that person once we get through them um um Sushmita asked do companies value data science certifications from MOOCs like Coursera Edx and Udemy?", "", "It depends on the company uh like I saw um Google was saying they come out with like a career certification that they said they would count the same as a four-year college degree and I think one of them is like data analytics so I guess in that case yes um I would say more so I think it you can keep it on there it can be like like a nice little plus like cool they're continuing to educate yourself it's probably not enough to get you the job or even to get you necessarily the interview right because I think some folks still have doubts you know compared to like a four-year college degree they're like oh well like you know could they have cheated because they have just watched his lectures passively so I think much more effective is taking that knowledge that you learn in the course and applying it in a project so I don't think it will hurt but I don't necessarily think it's going to be a big factor in deciding whether to interview or hire you.", "", "", "Okay sorry about that I had to close the window the sirens were very loud um in New York um (indistinct name) I I don't know if i'm pronouncing the name um correctly asks uh do you have any specific advice for people who are switching careers?", "", "Yeah I mean I think so pretty much everything I said in the talk like applies right some of it a little more so like I mentioned earlier like project portfolios might be especially helpful um but I really do think two things one you know with this like let go of the data scientist title like it depends like how far away was your previous career right is your previous career software engineer which is like pretty adjacent to data science or was it a I don't know art historian at the MET which like is pretty unrelated in terms of domain uh although you know again you have think but in that case thing about communication skills like what can you bring and how can you maybe start doing data as part of your job now so I don't really know much about art historians but like can you analyze some data can you you know post make a blog post about like you know some of the works or like some history of art and like show a visualization of how that changed over time so if you think about switching careers try to find ways can you incorporate data analysis data science into your current job um and if at all possible because that can be a really good way when you're you know talking in job interviews or writing on your resume that you can be like yes I know this sounds like an unrelated career but actually look I found this way to do data I got these communication skills um just really think about how you can frame what you're doing as something relevant to the field.", "", "", "Right the next question is from Juan who asks for someone trying to switch careers into data science is a masters in data science a good idea or are there better ways to get into the industry?", "", "So we have we write it all right so chapter 3 is on exactly this which is like how do I get the skills to be a data scientist um I think masters is one way the downside is the cost in terms of", "like the actual monetary cost and also the opportunity costs right so if you're doing a full-time master's you probably can't work so you're not earning a salary for that time the other thing with data science masters specifically is you really want to be thoughtful and um and picking the school because there are some good programs out there but they're all relatively new right like none of them really existed before five years ago uh and some of them are just trying to cash in on this", "phase uh and will be taught you know maybe they'll be teaching like outdated technologies or none of the professors have worked in industry or they just cobbled together like these statistics these computer science courses without actually like making it a uh you know curriculum that goes together so how you can sort of tell that is definitely look at the syllabus if you know some folks in data science like you reach out to them uh talk what they think about it also really ask and look at the alums like what are people who graduated from this program doing how will this help you find a job so it's one way the other a couple ways we cover are you could uh do a boot camp um and you can learn on the job so like I talked about the art store and how can I use data on my job or third you can self teach right you can do online courses and things like that so if you want to learn more definitely check out chapter three but that's sort of my short bit on data science masters.", "", "", "Okay um this next question that I really like is what is the best part and worst part of your current job? ", "", "Uh so yeah so I I I think um I'll actually say look kind of it's it's a twofold thing of kind of like in in some ways like the same thing being in some ways the best and the worst which is", "uh I now work on a centralized team of data scientists so previously at Etsy I reported to another well at that time another data analyst but I was embedded with the search team so I was in their Slack channel I was in their meetings uh you know they were the people who were kind of like day to day like telling me like you know what are some things that I should work on and then at my last company I reported to the vice president of growth so I was fully embedded in the growth team which", "was running experiments and now at Warby Parker the data science team is centralized so we're like a", "small data science core team and we work with different departments usually for a couple months at a time so that's been something that's been really exciting because you know we get to have an impact", "on lots of different departments but it's also you know sometimes I miss like being working really closely with another team like getting to know them at you know individually really well really getting to know that problem space versus you know more of like a couple months like deployment working on one specific project uh so I don't think you know that's something also to think about when looking at data science jobs you can definitely ask about them they may use different terminologies but the two things to look for essentially are will you report to another data", "scientist or to you know like the head of the e-commerce team and uh are you going to be mainly", "working with one team or does your team you know work with lots of teams and you'll switch maybe every couple months.", "", "Okay uh the next question is for um our is from Artemis um related questions are Cecily what are good resources for brushing up on statistics probability and other math topics necessary for data science?", "", "Yeah so I'm going to post uh one link here so Naked Statistics is a really good um introductory like especially if you have very little background in statistics it's like a great like very friendly", "like no there's not a lot of equations it's more about how do i think about statistics like what do these terms mean um so that's a good place to get started and then the other one I recommend is Introduction to Statistical Learning so this is like a very classic book uh in the field it's also available for free online uh there is code in R that's included along with it but even if you're learning Python you can I don't know if you want you could try to translate the code but you could also uh you know just focus most of the book is not about the code it's about the concepts uh and I really think if you you know just go through that book and learn that pretty well that is you know pretty much all the statistics and machine learning you need to get started", "", "Okay the next job is the next question the next question is from Gia Wu the current job market is still competitive every DS job exam's job has thousands of applications is building connection and getting to this recruiter getting to the recruiter the only way to get through this?", "", "[Music] so it depends on the company right so I would not say necessarily every data science job as thousands of applications because like a small startup that most people haven't heard of is probably not getting a thousand applications but yes like well pre-covered times I would say AirBnB although of course they've had to lay off people and have a hiring freeze but like you know Google uh you know all the kind of like big names like yes those do actually have thousands of applications and it's true like the really the main way that people get that is through a referral so through someone", "that already works there that you know you've maybe worked with them before or potentially you get by reaching out or knowing the recruiter so that's why I would say like maybe don't start with those companies but look at like okay what are some smaller companies what are some local companies you know if you don't live in New York City or San Francisco you know you might also have an advantage there like I don't know you're in uh Nashville is not that small city but like you know a city like Nashville where yes on the one hand there are fewer data science jobs but on the other hand you know they're less competition there's less people vying for them uh so I do think yes most the time uh for these really prominent companies uh some of them do like the ones in the middle like I think Etsy when I was there did look at every resume that came through at least skimmed it but some companies do have automated systems that you know narrow down these thousand resumes based on keywords to the 100 that a uh recruiter will look for and sometimes they do employ some rules of thumb like okay if it's a new grad position this is your GPA or you have to be from the schools or", "you have to have this major um and so in that case yes I do think like having those connections is always going to be really really helpful but it's possible and people do get jobs especially at smaller companies by applying on their website.", "", "The next question is from Wasilla if you're already good at either Python or R would it be a plus to learn the other language as well?

data scientist is becoming more of a title uh for people with at least a few years of work experience even if not necessarily as a data scientist say as like a data analyst or a software engineer so again that's sort of like maybe letting go of the title like some companies just don't hire junior data scientists they don't hire entry level they hire data analysts for that role uh or other things like that um and then finally uh if you can if your school that you graduate from has a career resources center like definitely go to that um you know ask them for help with your resume a lot of them will do this for free if you're a recent grad uh and reach out on LinkedIn to people who've graduated from say your same major um or you know who just wanted your career that you're interested and say hey I'm a recent graduate from you know x university which this person also went to you know I saw that you're you know a data scientist at this company I'm really interested in the field I majored in this uh you know would you have time to 30 minutes to chat you don't recognize especially in these times like for example parents of young kids just may not have a lot of extra time but there are lots of people who like helping people and also maybe especially like new graduates especially someone they have a connection to even if that connection is just that you graduated from the same school.",

wants to progress into the data world what program would you suggest starting with?", "", "Yes so I would so I would suggest um so there's lots of different options here but I would maybe start out with reading I'm also going to post this in the chat uh if people feel free to chime in if you have Python resource like I said I'm more of an R person but like let's start with the R for data science book which is available for free online uh you know start looking for that I really like it because um for example Python like there are some for this but there are a lot of i wouldn't necessarily start with just like learn Python because they're going to talk about things that aren't", "that relevant to data science versus R for data science is like start by visualizing data which is like yes I want to visualize data um so if you have no prior experience I'd start with like okay first let's try something out and let's try you know read R for data science there's some built-in", "uh data sets in R and so just try like oh okay here's this bolted data center in cars how would I find which car has the most miles per gallon okay how would I narrow it down to just the cars that have you

it in your job or you've taken some online courses uh", "or you've you know read textbooks so if you don't feel you have those skills yet I would definitely kind of start there um you know and read up on and build those skills uh and then but once you do feel like that I think that's honestly something I would talk to your manager about I think first the question is is there area in your current job where you could use inference skills right is there area would be more stats focused because maybe there is and that could be a great place to start or maybe it turns out they're like you know what no like we really just don't we don't need it", "um if that's the case you can see like if your own judgment is maybe like actually they say this but I really think a model here would be useful

to show you're qualified for that job the first thing is one also your analytics experience will be uh will be relevant so even more inference jobs you're still doing a lot of like analytics work uh

thought I could do this but actually they're asking for this and like I'm really like not comfortable with understanding my outputs or you know making a recommendation from it then it's maybe time to

liberal arts major I don't have any of that so where do I start um honestly there was so I recommend like Introduction to Cisco Learning as a book I I'm not as good at answering this because I do have more of that formal background so I've picked I've definitely learned a lot on my own but it's mostly been sort of contained like oh I need to learn time series let me find the time series textbook or you know I need to learn how to handle this type of data in R so let me take this course so I don't fortunately don't necessarily have like a great recommendation for you but I think the important thing is to try to find something uh you know first think about how you learn best like there are some interactive courses uh you know online like do you would you like to do that or you're coding in the browser or are you someone who could you know just", "listen to a video an hour a video lecture and like take notes so think about like how how you can learn best uh you know will help you figure out like what types of courses.", "", "Okay the next question is from Lauren can you say more about your experience at Metis?", "", "Yeah so I did metis uh back in uh summer of 2016 so right after I finished uh my masters and yeah I enjoyed it it was a good fit for me so basically I had the statistics I had the R knowledge but I wanted uh to learn some more like machine learning to learn some Python and also to have some time to learn Git and GitHub and build a project portfolio so I enjoyed metas because that's what Metis is built around so you have about two hours of uh like course during the day but then the afternoon is all about working on your own project and that starts out like pretty structured so it's like okay work with the IMDB data set to make these predictions about movie ratings but by the end of it it's just like do something with Natural Language Processing like you have to come up with a question you get the data um but you know there's the instructors there to help there are other people in", "the class there to help so that worked really well for me I would say but the advantage I had there", "was I moved home so I moved back to New York uh so I lived rent-free with my parents uh and I hadn't like my master's degree I had a stipend but it wasn't sort of just enough to live on so it wasn't like I'd gone from making you know 70000 dollars a year and suddenly I had to figure out how do I live", "without a salary for the three months of Metis and it's going to take usually a couple months after graduating to start a job so I started my job about three months after medicine ended so a total of six months um you know where I wasn't making an income so you do have to definitely weigh that against uh what you can get from Metis but the last thing I'll say also is helpful is you know I wouldn't say most boot camps sort of like MOOCs they're not gonna like get you the job or maybe even the interview by having on your resume it's much more about the experience you have there so like what might get your job is not like oh she went to Metis it's like oh she did this this uh cool project and I see this blog post or she made this dashboard and that's exactly what we need so why don't we at least talk to her um so that's the advantage and finally uh it's also helpful that Metis now as well as other bootcamps have a fair amount of alumni because they've been around for a few years so that's also going to be helpful if you're interested in a company and I did this when I was looking uh there were fewer alumni then but there are a few companies I was interested in that I talked to a data scientist one referred me and also the other one said don't work here which was really helpful they were like this is not a good data science team and I never would have known that if not for having that connection uh through Metis and reaching out to them.", "", "All right um the next question is from Wassela this might be too specific to answer but when you're job hunting for your first data science job about what application to interview ratio would you expect?", "", "Yeah so and this is really yeah this is hard to answer because yeah it's kind of very specific per person so I think a big thing that influences this here is how like selective are you in your applications like are you only due to mostly only like i didn't apply to that many jobs um because I mostly applied through people I knew you know referrals or companies I had connections with so in that case it was a relatively high application to um the first interview because you know like I had like a decent background and you know I had the referrals so that was pretty high versus if I'd applied to a bunch of companies online cold applications that would have been very low uh so you know it really depends and then it is helpful though to analyze like okay what stages is there more drop-off like if I'm applying a bunch of places maybe I'm trying with for I'm trying these things I'm not getting anything okay maybe I should talk to some people is it how I present myself on my resume", "is it that i'm applying to the wrong types of jobs like I I you know it turns out like oh I'm fine", "all these jobs that need that really really want this formal degree that I don't have um or no I'm getting the hiring manager interviews and then I'm not going forward okay you know is what can I reflect on that part and so on and so forth so I think that's sort of more helpful but I would", "say I saw someone posting today who was laid off at AirBnB and they talked about their first data science job search versus their second and like those ratios and I think they said like it was either like ten or five percent maybe of applications got them to the next stage so if that's your case like don't definitely that's not abnormal again this person applied to I think like 130 companies so if you're applying to that many companies most of them are not going to get back to you if you don't have previous experience as a data scientist.", "", "Okay the next question is how important is it to get Object-Oriented Programming concepts Data Structures and Algorithms to get a data scientist job? ", "", "It depends I'll be honest I don't know I vaguely remember things about object-oriented program I don't really need in my job because R is much more about Functional Programming although you can use Object-Oriented Programming so in my case like I'm working I got a job and I'm working as a data scientist and I don't have that but so you know that being said uh you also mentioned I think like", "algorithms and stuff and if you're a machine learning engineer for example yes it is important to know", "you know like to know like owen write like the complexity of your algorithms because you know the speed's gonna really matter there you know they might ask you some sorting questions like you know bubble sort like how did you make this thing so it depends but I yeah I would say object oriented not", "necessarily if it's specifically listed in the job description it's probably worth brushing up on but I I wouldn't worry too much about it.", "", "Okay the next question is in terms of day-to-day work what are the differences and similarities between the work a developer software engineer does versus what a data scientist does?", "", "Yeah I mean this really like software engineering even of itself like their day-to-day can look so", "different right you might know the terms like back-end versus front-end engineer like someone you know that the programming language that they use it can be totally different the types of problems um", "but I would say in general like one thing that engineer much more common with engineering teams is to use uh Jira or another like task management tool to have tickets and to really really like scope down", "like okay this is like first I'm gonna like do this part then I'm gonna do this part of the product that I'm gonna do this part because there's a lot less uncertainty in most of software engineering like generally you're not worried like can I even build this website like you may have uncertainty about how to build it but you kind of know what can be done like someone hopefully you can do it but someone can do it versus in data science like a predictive modeling process like half the time you find out like oh the data's not there we need to figure out the data or oh this data like tracking down to 20 people to figure out what this data means like took three days so that that's delay in the project or oh I made the model and it just we we can't like it's trying to predict you know what's the next dice roll like even if you have a thousand data points on the past dice roll you're never gonna be able to make a predictive algorithm that predicts the next one uh so I do think like that's the uncertainty inherent in data science does change like some of the process so some teams some data scientists teams do use Agile do you use the Sprint these two-week systems um or Jira tickets but I would say not many more software engineering teams do uh and again like I don't know the jobs are", "similar like I don't a new code but um otherwise I think that they're quite different in the types of problems that you're working on. ", "", "The next question is um how real is the threat of jobs lost to automated machine learning tools aka Auto ML?", "", "So this actually um I don't think one it's not very great because of what I said before that like", "so much of the work is not like optimizing the uh you know like which like machine learning algorithm I use it's much about like how do I get the data what problems should we even be solving how do I talk", "to people how do I put this in production so it can be you know like this algorithm needs to serve our customer service team that's and it's going to be hit you know 5 million times a week so I would say not not much uh that being said like uh I think uh I'm gonna find it um Eduardo De La Rubia had a great pack in our studio which was not the worry that like ml teams are gonna be replaced by Auto ML", "but actually that the problem is data scientists don't necessarily have much of a competitive advantage there and engineers could actually be the ones replacing these machine learning teams because you know they have a lot of the capabilities and they just have to get up to speed in the machine learning part so that actually I think is the the bigger worry.
