visible now\ni see drag and drop files i think it\nmight just be loading yep now we can see\nyour screen\nall right is it visible\nyes okay yeah uh\nhello everyone i'm ridhoo bhatnagar i'm\nfrom india\nand i am a software engineer by\nprofession\nand when i am not programming or\nbuilding stuff then i\nlove giving talks at various meetups and\nconferences\nso during this time i have been giving\ntalks all across the group\nin every possible meetup that is\npossible\nso into today's session we'll be\ncovering up\nabout building a conversational bot for\nwhatsapp\nand here is the bot uh you like\non the left hand side you may be seeing\nuh\nuh what jf uh\nthis one this is the what i had recently\nbuilt it is vocab but\nand the features it includes it are\nit tells you the word definition it\ntells synonyms it tells antonyms and it\ntells examples\nbased on whatever you query it for so\nlike it is squaring\nexamples for amazing so this would\nreturn some examples for amazing\nso this was the board that i had\nrecently built\nand the session for today we would be\ncovering that how\nyou too can build any build any of the\nbots\nand bring your ideas to life so\nmoving ahead the requirements for\nuh this session include that\nwhat i have used is i have used python\nversion 3.6\ngreater than 3.6 and then we will be\nusing flask\nfor running the web server and then we\nwill be using\nanother package that is ngrok ngrok is\nbasically used for testing up\nour bot with the mobile application so\nthere is there needs to be some way\nwhere we can\njust test whether the bot is working as\nexpected or not\nso for that we will be using ngro and\nall these things that i have mentioned\nare pip installable so pip\nis the python package manager you just\nhave to do\npipe like pip install flask paper\ninstall\nngrok uh sorry ngrok is not\nprep installable for ngrok you need to\ngo on to\nngrok website and from ngrok website you\ncan download ngrok\nso that is how you install ngrok and\nthen all you need\nis a smartphone with whatsapp installed\non it\nand then there needs to be a twilio\naccount\nso this is the url at the bottom is for\ncreating the twilio account\ni can maybe share this link\nor okay later i can share this link\nso that if you want you can just open up\nand create your own accounts i will just\nshare it just a second\nif you are following along or later you\nwant to create\na twilio account you can use this url\nthat i have put up in the chat\nthe initial account trial account is\nbasically free so it won't charge you\nanything\nso moving ahead here is how you can\nconfigure your twilio whatsapp sandbox\nso once you have created your account on\ntwilio\nyou can just go on to twilio console sms\nwhatsapp learn this url so first\nand foremost thing is to create uh\nthe\naccount on twilio and then there is\nsomething as twilio sandbox\nso our application basically will be\ncommunicating to\ntwilio so imagine that you have opened\nyour\nwhatsapp and you are querying your\nwhatsapp\nwith uh like suppose you wanted word\ndefinition\nor you are saying hi to your whatsapp so\nwhatever message you are sending to the\nwhatsapp should go to twilio so we are\ntrying to make a connection between\nwhatsapp\nand twilio so for that connection to\nhappen\nthis url is what is needed\nconnection between\nwhatsapp and twilio\nso the url that i had sent above was for\nconnection between\nwhatsapp and twilio and if you have\nalready created that\nthis account and you go on\nto this url this is how your page would\nlook like\ni'll just expand it\nthis is how basically your screen is\ngoing to look like\nonce you are on our twilio sandbox\ni cannot uh live uh like i cannot go on\nthe actual website and show you live\nbecause there are some secret codes that\nare there\nthat are not to be shown so make sure\nthat whenever\nyou two are using the twilio application\nyou hide your own codes don't\njust go and put it up on github or\nsomewhere these are your own codes\nand so the left hand side number that\nyou see\nhere is something that you have to store\nyou have to save it on your mobile phone\nand this is your joining code so once\nyou save this contact number on your\nmobile phone\nthis contact would basically appear on\nyour whatsapp contacts\nso this is your whatsapp contact\nnumber and this is the joining code\nand everyone is going to have their\ndifferent joining codes and joining\ncodes\ncode needs to be hidden because after a\ncertain point of time when all the\ntwilio free credits are over\nit are like every query is chargeable\nso that's why don't just disclose your\nsecret code otherwise others will be\nable to use it and your free credits\nwill be gone so that is the reason\nbasically to hide it\nso next step is after you create the\naccount just\nsave whatever number comes on to your\nscreen\nyou will have to save it on your phone\nand then uh\nthis is the joining code so on your\nwhatsapp what you have to do is the\nfirst\nmessage you will see is join followed by\nwhatever is the code this message you\nwill have to send on the whatsapp\nnow this whole setup make sure that our\nwhatsapp is being connected to twilio\nthis is the very first part of the chat\nbot\nokay and now as if you have already\nsaved the number\nso this is the initial step of the board\nthat we have already done\ni saved that number using the name vocab\nbot you can save it by anything that you\nlike\nso this is the very initial step\nand now how we will go on doing this\nprogrammatically\nis what i what i am going to explain in\nthe next steps\nso the next steps include creating a\npython virtual environment\nso once you create once you have the\ninitial thing set up\nall you have to do is by create a python\nvirtual environment\nso i'll just briefly explain what is\nmeant by a virtual environment in case\nyou don't\nknow so what happens is in python\nwe install all the external packages by\ndoing\npip install and if we are not using the\nvirtual environment\nall these packages get globally\ninstalled\non our system so as a result a lot of\ntimes between\nmultiple projects there can be version\nconflict\nsuppose you are using django one\nsuppose you are using django two in one\nproject and django three in another\nproject then\nit is difficult for the project to\ndetermine that\nwhich django version should i use\nso to avoid scenarios like these we use\npython virtual environment and here are\nthe steps to create\nthe virtual environment so that there is\nno virgin conflict\nnow in case you are a mac or linux user\nuh all you have to do is run the\nfollowing commands\nso mkdir is basically for creating a new\ndirectory that is the whatsapp bot\nand the cd was for changing the\ndirectory\nof the bot and then python minus\nm when whatsapp bought when you do uh\nthis command creates the virtual\nenvironment\nwhen is the package\nand whatsapp what is your name of the\nvirtual environment that you are going\nto create\nif when is not installed on your system\nyou will have to install\nwhen on your system\nand then once the virtual environment is\nlike once this\nvirtual environment is created all you\nhave to do is\nactivate the virtual environment that is\nsource\nwhatsapp bin activate\nso then you have to activate\nthis virtual environment and ah you\nwould come to know whether the\nenvironment is activated or not by this\nlast command\nso if you are able to see on the left\nhand side that\nsuch a thing is coming like whatsapp\nwhich means that the bot has got\nactivated and now i am just installing\nmy requirements i need a twilio library\nthen i need requests and request\nis the http library in python it helps\nus in communicating with the external\nthird party apis\nor any kind of apis for that matter and\nthen\nflask is a micro web framework in python\nand python.10 is another package it is\nused to save all our secret keys\nso\nand if you are a windows user then the\ncommands are different\nso for making the directory you need to\ndo md whatsapp bot for changing we have\nwhatsapp what\nthen we have python minus and when\nwhatsapp bot\nthis is for again creating the virtual\nenvironment\nthen we are trying to activate the\nvirtual environment and then\nsimilarly you just need to install all\nthe requirements\nso before we go ahead i would like to\ntell that twilio we are installing so\nthat\nuh from twilio we are able to send some\nreq\nresponse to the bot so if you send any\nmessage to your bot\nthe bot must reply something and for the\ngetting the reply from the bot we need\nto install a twilio application so that\nit sends us\nsome response and request library is for\ncommunicating with any third party\nlibrary\nflask flask is basically\nthe micro frame framework that is used\nfor running the server at our back end\nand then python.10 we are using so that\nwe don't disclose any secret key\nto anyone it needs to be saved on our\npart\nand we'll see uh everything working\nlater in the session and now before i\ngo on with the code are there any\nquestions or anything till now or\nsomething that i\nhaven't explained in greater detail so\nyou can ask the question if there i\ndidn't\ni don't see any questions uh so far\nexcept is the webinar being recorded\nwhich it is um but if anybody has any\nquestions feel free to post on the\num um yeah we will have a link to the\nslides afterwards\nokay\nyeah so moving ahead the next step\nbasically is\nthat how that we need to clear create a\nflask chatbot\nservice so we are trying to create the\nservice because\nwe need to send some data to the user\nso the workflow basically is user enters\nthe query to the whatsapp\nand then instead of a human being\nreplying to you there is a bot\nthere and instead of human the bot is\nbasically replying to you\nso for this whole workflow to take place\nwe need\nflask applications there needs to be a\nserver running that would keep on\nreplying to your messages\nso this is how we create the very first\nstep is\nso uh in the presentation here i won't\nbe explaining the process of building\nvocab bot\nbut i am explaining a general uh\ngiving a general idea that how\nyou can create your own bots and bring\nyour own ideas to life and\nthis is the very basic like hello world\nof bots we can say like that this is the\nvery basic bot that you can\ncreate on your own and then feel free to\nincorporate your own ideas and convert\nthose into bots\nso i am just explaining a very generic\nprocess\nso this is the very first step of\ncreating the flask service\nso first i am trying to import\nflask class so i am doing from flask\nimport flask in line 1 and then\ni am initializing the app from flask\nclass and all i am doing then\nis app.root hello world\nso whatever communication is going to\ntake place\nis going to take place through this\nendpoint hello world\ni am going to post my messages on hello\nworld\nendpoint and whatever the user\nis sending will also be coming on this\nhello world end point\nso we'll be seeing ahead how this\nhappens\nand app.run allows us to run the server\nabdul run basically allows us to run the\napplication\nand by default the application runs on\nport number 8000 localhost port 8000\nso our initial very initial setup is\nthis now the next\nstep is when i have already created one\nendpoint and i know that this is where i\nneed to send my data\nthe next point is how are we going to\nreceive the incoming message from the\nuser\nso now for that to happen all you need\nto do is\napp dot hello world method\npost we are trying to post something\nand then we do request dot values dot\nget\nand body dot lower so what this conveys\nis that if the request message contains\na key\nnamed as body then we need to we are\ntrying to\nfetch the value corresponding to this\nbody\nand if it doesn't find any key\ncorresponding to but\nlike if it doesn't find the key body\nthen the message would be\nempty and then i am trying to convert my\nwhole message\ninto lower case\nso that is the meaning of this whole\nline request\ndot values dot get i am trying to\nget the value and\nwhatever is the value that the user\nsends to the whatsapp bot so in your\nwhat if you write hi\nso here in this function your incoming\nmessage would be high\nif the user is sending hello the\nincoming\nvalue of incoming message would be hello\nso\nline number six is just for retrieving\nthe incoming message by the user\nnext step is uh\nwe we like want to willy\nto send a message to the user back\nso for that purpose twilio has a\nmessaging response it has a twilio ml\nlibrary in it so if you want to check\nout\nall these documentation are very well\nexplained on the twilio's website\nwebsite itself so whenever you are\nbuilding one for your own\nyou can just check the documentation\nthere wml is the library\nso what we are trying to do is we are\ntrying to initialize this class\nmessaging response then we have a\nresponse object with us\nand in the response i want that i should\nsend a message\nso all i am doing is response dot\nmessage and here\ni am initializing the variable message\nwith it\nand then my app is still running for\nrunning my app i am doing\napp dot run line number eight and line\nnumber nine\nwhy we are doing this is because this is\na format that is suggested by twilio\nso only when you have this format in\nyour application you would be able to\nsend\nthe message back to the user\nso step one is user is sending the\nmessage to twilio\nthat is line number seven line number\neight and nine is twilio is trying to\nsend back\nsomething to the user so that is what\nline number 7\n8 and 9 are doing\nand now what we want is that whenever\nthe incoming message is high\nthe output message should be hello hope\nyou have a good day\nso now i am saying that\na user is entering the message high so\nyour\nvalue of incoming message in line number\nseven would be high\nand then when you are doing response is\nequal to messaging response\nmessage is equal to response dot message\nwhen we do this thing\nfrom here i am trying to now send\nthe bot is trying to send the message to\nthe user\nso there is another built-in method in\nthat library itself that is message.body\nso\nnow i am doing is hello plus the\nincoming message\nso hello would be\nis a static thing that i am sending and\nplus the incoming message\nso suppose the incoming message is high\nso\nthe returned response would be hello hi\nor suppose if i am sending the incoming\nmessages\ni am sending my name itself so it would\nsay hello\nif the user is sending word world so the\noutput is hello world\nso this is a very trivial application of\nhow\nmessage sending and message receiving\ntakes place\nin this bot\nat the moment we are stands uh i am\nsending some static messages\nthat always this is going to return\nhello plus the incoming message but we\ncan say\nsend dynamic messages as well like i was\ndoing in the vocab bot\nso for sending dynamic messages we need\na\nwe basically need an api so that we'll\nbe discussing ahead\nbut the process of the that workflow of\nincoming messages\nand outgoing message is this\nthat you see here are there any doubts\ntill now\nuh yeah the presentation slides i i'll\nbe sharing\nany doubts apart from the presentation\nslide thing are there any questions\nor have i gone too fast\ni don't see any other questions there so\nthat's good\nokay are things\nunderstandable to till now or it is a\nbit confusing\nokay so we'll just and here uh i'm sorry\ni think\nthis is going to be hello plus\nhigh so if the incoming message was high\nthe output that\nour function was sending was hello and\nfollowed by hello a high\nthis is a very trivial application just\nto make things\neasier and so that you understand the\nprocess of building the bot\nand usually the way the risk request and\nresponse\ntwilio accepts is in the xml format\nso it is not json format it is xml\nformat\nand the body keyword that we were using\nwas\nthis body keyword and if you have to\nsend any image\nso for image you need to use media key\nso all this is very well explained in\ntheir documentation\nand just for running your application\nall you have to do is python app.py\nso earlier by mistake i have said that\nwe are running\nthe application on port number 8000\nso i am sorry for that the port is not 8\n000\nthe application is running on port port\n5000 all right\nso once all your code is ready and in\nplace\nall you have to do is run your\napplication so now your application is\nrunning\nbasically on port 5000\nso now what problem do we have is\nwe want the bot to run on whatsapp\nand whatsapp is on your mobile and\nyour code is on your laptop so there are\ntwo different website\ntwo different devices that we want to\ncommunicate in between\nso uh the next step is how how do the\ncommunication between the two devices\nhappen\nso that communication happens with the\nuse of this\nngrok so initially i had told that you\nneed to install\nngrok from the from its website so now\nnext step\nis like you open another terminal on\nyour laptop\ngo on to the location where this ngrok\nhas got installed\nso usually it would be in your downloads\nfolder and then\nall you have to do is run dot slash\nngrok http 5000\nwhat this will do is this will run ngrok\nat port 5000 so now you have\non one terminal flask running on another\nterminal you have this\nngrok running there are two things\nrunning\nand now twilio will help us in\nconnecting these two devices\nso the terminal would look something\nlike this when you once you\nrun your ngrok the terminal is going to\nlook something like this\nokay so now next step is making a\nconnection with\ntwilio so now all you have to do is\njust copy this forwarding url on\neveryone's laptop the forwarding url\nwill be different\nso now next step is for connecting the\ntwo devices you have to just\ncopy paste copy the url and then\nby copying the url you just need to\nuh put the url in\nin the twilio sandbox for whatsapp you\nwould be able to\nsee this twilio sandbox in the console\nitself just go on to the twilio website\nall these things are available there\nand as i had mentioned above add your\nngrok forwarding url in the text box\nso you have to add the ngrok url here\nand then after adding the ngrok url at\nthe end you have to put\nslash and followed by the end point\nhello world that we had used\nso forwarding url followed by the end\npoint that was hello world\nso this is basically now everything is\nset now twilio knows how the\ncommunication between the devices\nneeds to take place\nand now if you test your flask service\nagain\nyou would see that the communication is\ntaking place whenever you\nsend hi will you would send you hello\nfollowed by a high or based on whatever\ncode that you have\nwritten in the in your application so\nthis is a very\nsimple application that i had demoed on\nhow to build a bot\nand the next one was\nhow to how do we send a dynamic response\nor how dynamic responses\nare to be sent so we in the above\nexample we were sending\nthe static responses that\nif whenever you send hello it will send\nyou high\nbut for dynamic responses what can be\ndone is\nthere are lot of apis already available\nso there is some examples of apis are\nthere is google maps api there is cad\npictures api you have twitter api news\napi github api\nnow you can use all these use cases with\nyour whatsapp so one use case could be\nyou are sending some location or you are\nsuppose sending latitude and longitude\nand then google maps returns you the\nlocation on the map\nor you are sending some location and the\ngoogle map returns you that exact map\nlocation\nor you you are interested in seeing some\ncat picture so you just\nand start querying that cat pictures api\nor you are just interested in knowing\nthe trend what is trend\ntrending on twitter and you are\ninterested in seeing\nthat trending twitter thing on whatsapp\nso you can just use the twitter api\nor you are interested in reading the\ngoogle news on whatsapp\nso you can use google news for that if\nyou want your\nto check whether the open source project\nyou are contributing to\nhas some new pull requests on it or has\nsome new\nissues opened on it so instead of\nopening it up time and again you can\njust\nuse whatsapp for it if you are more\naccustomed to using whatsapp\nso these are couple of use cases and for\nthe bot that i had basically initially\nshown you\nso for that what i am also using an api\nfor that\nso there is a dictionary api\nthat i had used\nso the dictionary api was miriam's\nwebster's api so that merriam-webster's\napi returns\nall this word definition synonyms\nantonyms and examples\nand that is how for any random word i\nwas entering\nuh the bot was returning me\na response dynamic response\nand using twilio is also net\nnot necessary to leo we are using\ni am using twilio but\noriginal whatsapp api can be used\nthe problem however with whatsapp api is\nthat it is not a developer api by this i\nmean\nis like first you need to be a business\nowner\nonly then you would be able to use the\noriginal whatsapp api\ni don't think they have opened the\nwhatsapp api\nfor even the developers to use for their\nprojects\nso there is some kind of restriction at\ntheir end and also they are very\nparticular about what kind of messages\nyou send\nso suppose if someone is trying to spam\nanyone or someone is trying to\nsend incorrect messages then whatsapp\nblocks the user\nso before deciding on to the use case\nfor\nbuilding the bot first before using the\napis the use case needs to be very well\nthought of\nthat what we are trying to send and\nwhatsapp also has certain restrictions\nthat what should be the template of the\nmessages that the bot is sending\nand also with whatsapp uh\nthe thing is you need to get approval\nfrom whatsapp\nfor using all these things\nso and one way to put this bot in\nproduction is like if you just want to\nput your twilio broad\nfor in production and run it so you can\nmaybe deploy\nit on heroku so i i use my bot\noften and i have deployed it on hiroku\nas\ni don't own any business and i'm not\nusing whatsapp official apis\nso i'm basically i have basically\ndeployed it on heroku and i have\nkept the secret keys with me so it is\njust used for private purposes\nand uh these days if you would have\nnoticed\nlot of businesses are using whatsapp as\na platform for marketing\nso it has pretty good business use case\nattached to it\nand companies can use it and are using\nit for providing customer support\nand even some companies are using it for\nbroadcasting the messages\nregarding events and all so there can be\nvarious business use cases attached to\nwhatsapp\nso this was all i had and if you are\ninterested in building the vocab bot\nitself\nuh so here is a blog that i had recently\nwritten\nfor twilio themselves\nso here is the bot\nurl so whenever you are trying to build\nit\nif you want to build the same one or\ntrying to have some\nidea you can just check out this blog\nthe blog has\nis beginner friendly blog so it has\ndetailed\nexplanation of why a particular decision\nis taken\nand why i am doing what i am doing so\nyou can just add a lot bought logic\nbased on your own needs and requirements\nso and the last step\nafter discussing these apis is as\nthroughout we were using python\nso in python just for integrating the\napi\nthere is a simple module that we use\nthat is requests\nso if you want to integrate any api to\nyour code\nall you have to do is use requests.get\nnow this method depends whether depends\non your api whether it accepts a get\nrequest\npost request but all you need to do is\ninstall requests and then there is a\nbuilt-in json module\nthrough json what gets done is json\nconverts your string data\ninto dictionary data and this dictionary\ndata in the end is parsable\nso instead of sending all your\ninformation returning all your\ninformation you can just\nsend the needed information to the user\nso this small snippet just\nexplains that part and based on your own\nuse case you can write your own logic\nand a lot of times it it is only about\nwriting conditional statements\nand\nif you are interested in exploring all\nof this further\nso if you are interested in flask then\nyou can check out the flask official\ndocumentation\nand blog link i have already shared with\nyou all\nand then github has a long list of\npublic apis that you can use\ni have only i had only listed a couple\nof them so you can\nhave a look at all these public apis as\nwell\nwhen you built one of your own so\nthank you that was all i had for the\nsession\ndoes anybody have any questions please\num feel free to um\npost them in the chat and i can read\nthem\nthanks so much for the presentation it\nwas great\nand thank you thank you\nokay so i'm just gonna turn on my mic\num i don't see um any questions here\num all right so um we'll be sharing the\nvideo soon with the link\num for the slides and a couple of links\nthat you posted\non um in the chat as well\nyeah those uh links are there in the\npresentation as well\nuh on the last video okay that's great\nso they'll be in the presentation\nyou'll be able to access them um\ngabrielle writes um i would have liked\nto learn a little bit more on how to\npublish the bot do you have resources\nfor that\nuh for publishing the bot i don't really\nhave resources but i have\ndone one another blog for twilio that\ntalks about this publishing thing\nso i think i can point to that one the\nhiroku part\nfor publishing that i'm using so\nokay\nhere is a another uh use case so this\nwas basically not\nfor uh okay sorry\nthis one is not basically using whatsapp\nbut it is using heroku so\nfrom here that publishing part you can\nlearn\nthat how you can publish your\nwork okay uh\nwe have another question which is is it\npossible to add\nml cognitive service from azure on the\nbot\num i am not really into\nml and i i am not very sure if that is\npossible or not\nbut you can check this out on\ntwilio's website on itself they have lot\nof blogs and there are a lot of people\nworking on lot of interesting ideas for\nthe bot so i think this azure thing you\ncan find it up there if someone has used\nor\nnot and if this uh azure service is an\napi\nitself then it can def definitely be\nused\nany kind of api you can integrate with\ntwilio\nokay uh next question i am new to flask\nwhat does flask\ndo uh flask uh i don't know if you have\nheard of django or not blood flask\nlike django is a web framework so web\nframeworks are basically\nused to build websites it helps in\neasing the process of building the\nwebsites for you\nso without the framework if you
