## Transcript 

## Intro (0:00)
Okay, so it says it's ready, great.
My name is Reshama Shaikh and I am the founder of Data Umbrella. I am also an organizer for NYC PyLadies and I am based out of New York City. 
Welcome to our - welcome to our session. 

Data Umbrella - Mission, Code of Conduct and Social Media
The mission of Data Umbrella is to provide a welcoming and educational space for underrepresented persons in Data Science. We welcome allies to help us in our
mission and we welcome all different skill levels. We are on Twitter @DataUmbrella, so feel free to tweet and share about the event and follow us. Also,
there is a LinkedIn page for us, where I usually share job postings, so you are welcome to join there and there is information on the website about a Discord - for community. 
I just want to go over the Code of Conduct, that you know we are dedicated to providing harassment free experience for everyone, be kind to others, be professional and respectful, we really want to build a friendly community here. Our Twitter is, just to repeat, @DataUmbrella and also @NYCPyLadies. And this is our Meetup page, so we'll be posting, I'll be posting any upcoming events on the Meetup page, even though this is webinar and it's available to anybody around the world, it's Meetup pages like the central page
where the events are posted. 

## Speaker Introduction (1:27)
I want to thank our speaker Shailvi Wakhlu, she'll be from joining from San Francisco and I want to thank our sponsor for providing this webinar platform which is Neo4j. 
And I'm just going to introduce Shailvi, I actually met Shailvi back in August in San Francisco, when I was there for the Write Speak Code conference. Shailvi is the Head
of Analytics at Komodo Health and as an analyst professional and former software engineer, Shailvi has been involved in shaping great products for companies big and small for the last 13 plus years. She's worked on various analyses, previously she worked at Salesforce. And she I guess, the really impressive thing here is, additionally, is that she has worked with a really large data, a data at scale, 40 million plus users. So, and then I am going to get out of this okay and then I think you should be able to screen share now.

## How Would Sherlock Holmes Fix Bad Data? 
Okay perfect. Oh give me a second here, all right. Can you see my screen?
Hey, are you able to see my screen? Yes. Okay,perfect. Okay, thank you. Yeah, all right.
Anyways, thank you all so much for joining in today. My name is Shailvi Wakhlu, thanks again Reshama for the introduction. 
And today, I am going to walk you all through how I think that Sherlock Holmes would have fixed back data and I hope you are all as excited about investigating data
anomalies as I am.

## About me 
So just to quick a little bit about me. So this is me as a child, I used to spend a lot of time reading detective novels and after I had finished reading one I used to go around hunting in my backyard for clues. I have no idea what I was what mystery I was trying to solve, but one day I found this big huge lemon, as you can see it's almost the size of my face and I didn't even know we had a lemon tree. So, for my five-year-old for my 11 year old self, this was actually the most important discovery I had ever made at that point and it just convinced me that I'm gonna go on to do very exciting things in my future and I don't think I ended up doing some exciting things. 
I worked with a lot of different companies of different sizes mostly in Analytics, which I've been involved in for almost a decade, but even though I started as an engineer and now I am the head of Analytics at Komodo Health, where I lead a team of eight data scientists.  

## Topics for today (4:21)
So today we're gonna talk about three things: one what is bad data, and why should you care about it, and how do we actually fix it.

## What is bad data? 
So sorry. Bad data is essentially, my definition, is that it's inaccurate,incomplete or misleading data and essentially what that encompasses is:
anything that's wrong anytime there is missing information or there is duplicate information, but it's not actually tagged as such, or there's some information or
data that's low quality that's incorrectly transformed, that can imply something different than what what it really means. All of that comes under the umbrella of bad data. 
Now, this is obviously just my definition. I'm sure what you really want is a scientific definition, and this is this is the best that I came up with. Bad data is anything
that makes you want to throw your computer across the room, because it just makes everything terrible. 

## What it isn't 
So I would like to call out that what bad data isn't: is just if it's not something that you don't want to see, or if it's not something that you feel good about, like that
doesn't make it bad data.  It's it still has to fit the requirement of it being inaccurate in some way and just because you don't like what it tells you it doesn't make it bad. 

## Some examples of how bad data manifests 
So with that distinction you know let's actually walk through a couple of quick examples of how I think bad data actually manifests. So one of the most common things that I have seen is that you know you're trying to pull up revenue numbers because revenue is important and you have a Salesforce table that says you made 32 million dollars last year and you have an internal table that says you made 35 million dollars. So automatically the question is, well, which one is right? And you know that three million dollar gap that is going to decide whether your company invests in more snacks for your kitchen, for example. So it's a really important thing to sort of solve for and you want to make sure that you trust the
data that you have and if you don't trust it like you have some caveats attached to it and things like that.

The other really common thing that shows up is, just you know something where the analysis just looks really suspicious. So in the, in you know in this new chart, you can see that you, it shows you revenue by country and it shows you, you have twenty five million dollars that you made in UK and then you note that you're actually a company that's located in North America. You haven't even ever marketed in Europe, so all the North American countries make sense, so you know who are all these people in UK who are buying your product.
It just doesn't make sense, that it would be the biggest country where you'd have revenue from, so things like this, they basically you know are a starting point.
Where you start wondering what's going on and you know what is this bad data, or like where is all this information coming from? 

## Phases of introducing bad data (7:32)
And the next logical question that comes up, is you know where, where is this bad data getting created, created in the first place?  So for me, like the way I think about it, there is essentially a life cycle of data. That has many phases and each of those phases has some inherent risks that are associated with it where bad data can be introduced. So I know there's a lot of information on this slide and I'm going to try to break it down. 

I put it as one visual because I actually, personally, have this printed out on my desk because I like to refer to it, just to sort of fact check. You know any investigation
that I'm struggling with I try to make sure I'm covering my bases. So, say, let me let me walk you through what's actually in here. So on the on the left you see the the five different phases of introducing bad data. 

So the first one that we start off is, is just the definition, this is where you know the data team and the product team are reconciling and they're saying what are the features that we even want to consider as one coherent unit and then what data 
requirements do we sort of associated it with it.

After that, you go on to logging where you actually translate some of those definitions that you had created in the previous 
step and turn them into actual code that you can use to log and store that data. 

After that, you are transforming that data in some way and what you're essentially looking at is you're looking at your business rules and you're applying those rules to do that tracked data so that you can convert it into a format that actually makes sense that is actually usable. 

After that, comes the fun part, you're actually analyzing it. So data scientists typically, they have to interpret the data based on you know actual business questions that they're
trying to solve for and that is that is where a lot of the action happens.

And finally, after this you actually share out your results and it can happen in a bunch of different ways. It can happen in the way of an ad-hoc analysis or some, some self-service reports, things like that and all of these these things are shared directly with stakeholders. 

So during all of these phases, I've you know on the on the right, I've kind of highlighted a few common things that I observe in each of the phases, like which are just according to me, they're the most they're the most logical places where something goes wrong. So I actually look at all of these things just as a as a sanity check when I'm trying to investigate what happened. I'm going to walk you through a couple of them, I won't walk you through all, but because some of them I'll be discussing later when I'm talking about fixes. So you know some of the most obvious ones,or most common ones that I see, is actually in the definition stage. So you know when we when we think about features, anything that we are trying to track it has some sort of a definition associated with it and how we define that feature can make a lot of difference in to what insights they're able to get from it at a later stage. 

So if you don't evenly apply the same, you know same sort of intention behind some of these feature definitions, it can get quite confusing later on. So an example here is that, let's say you you know your product team says I want to track all clicks on this page. Any click that happens I want to check it, so that's so pretty like it's a pretty all-encompassing definition, but you also have you know as a team that's dedicated to tracking things that occur on mobile and so in mobile environment they'll be like yeah
I want to track the chicks there too. So initially you logically think that all my all my clicks on the on the website are being tracked and some, some subset of them would have happened on the mobile. But if mobile team decides to not track all the clicks and only like three of the buttons that you can possibly click, then you have definitions that are
not evenly aligned because you'd assume that you know the the website clicks are still kind of the superset of everything, but you'd expect that the mobile subset
is a full subset for all mobile clicks but it's actually only tracking three, three types of clicks. So that can cause issues because anybody who's done this
long enough, knows that they'll always be that one person who'll say I want that one click on mobile that nobody's tracking. Like give me information on that, like you know you're giving me information about everything else, what about that one. So the more thoughtful you are upfront about like making sure you're tracking everything evenly it'll
it'll just be easier in the in the long run. 

The other example is at the analysis phase, so you know I think that's again one of the most common things that happen. That you just don't define the problem it's it's very ambiguous because especially when we're you know one human talking to another human, you know you're two separate humans. So you're always gonna have some things that you're not
where you're not aligned, where you don't understand each other. And you know if you're talking to a product manager they can make certain assumptions, that like oh I'm sure they already know this, and then you can make certain assumptions, like oh I already like of course they know that this can't happen. So if you don't actually clarify some of those,
that can result in some very tough consequences. You know you may end up spending a lot of time doing some work which has to be redone because there was an incorrect assumption in the first place, or worse maybe the error never gets discovered because you are all you're both calling it the same thing but you're actually doing something that's completely
different. So these type of examples you know, you can, you can kind of look through the remaining ones later but these are some common things that kind of show up. 

## Why should organizations care?

All right, so why should organizations or you know anybody even care about all this bad data? Now that we've seen a couple of ways it showed up.

## Bad data is costly in many different ways (14:06)

So I think inherently the big takeaway that I have seen over the years is that bad data is just costly. It's costly at every single level across the company. I think, you know, to start with the people who are working, who have to deal with it. It is it hampers their productivity, if you don't upfront spend that time and effort in trying to keep things clean
and it affects our morale, because they feel that you know this is, this is just I spend so much time doing something I don't want to do. It can also affect, it can cause liabilities, you can sometimes end up sharing information that you had you're not supposed to, or you shared incorrect information. That's specially a problem if if you're a public traded publicly traded company and you had an earnings call where you said, I have you know X number of monthly active users and then the next earnings call you're like, well just kidding, it's actually 20% lower because I made a mistake. 

That's not gonna look good and you might your company might actually get sued for, for misleading shareholders. So bias of course is a big problem, you know if you if you have some, if you have some data that's inherently biased and that's not known to you. Like that's just it's it's it's a it's it's a it's a issue because it can cause harm to people based on
whatever decisions are being made with that data and overall you know you can also just straight-up lose revenue. So if you have a bad data pipeline and data goes missing, maybe your Marketing team doesn't have leads to follow up on and that can lead to material revenue, revenue costs. Overall, I think the biggest, the biggest reason that I think this is important is also because it lowers trust. The minute your customers find out that there is something sketchy going on with your data, that can often be just game over for you, because if they do if they don't trust your data they don't inherently trust you. 

## Data scientist morale is reason enough ... 

The one thing that I again, like to sort of highlight a little bit more is that I think you know, besides all those other reasons which have a cost attached to it. I think just the fact, that data scientists have low moral because it's something like this, is reason enough for people to care about it. You know data scientists have to find the error, find
the source, validate cross checking, it so it's a lot of work that goes into resolving some of these issues. And I think inherently it very much is a part of a data scientist job to do this, but inherently they feel well my skills are so much, you know there's so much other cool stuff that I can be doing. And so everyone wants to be they everyone wants
their talents to be used in an optimal way. And you don't want people leaving leaving a job just because they're always dealing with dirty data issues. 

## How do we solve it? By thinking like Sherlock Holmes!

So good. So next you know how do we actually solve it. My my thought here is, I think, I think we solve it by thinking like Sherlock Holmes and for for those of you who are not familiar with him. Sherlock Holmes is a fictitious character created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, he is arguably one of the most famous fictional detectives and there's a lot of books
and movies about like that character, so check it out if you haven't had the chance to. 

## Why Sherlock Holmes? (17:44)

So, why did I actually pick Sherlock Holmes. For you know, why did I pick that we should emulate his his style, so I actually think that his style of solving crimes is very relevant to data scientists. Even though hopefully we're not solving crimes, just data issues, but I think inherently we're doing investigations and I think a lot of his personality traits are very good. If you think of a philosophy of how data scientist should think, I think it's very it's it's it's a it's very relevant and inherently Sherlock Holmes is always
presented as a very very data-driven character, so I think his methodologies are actually extremely relevant. And the three sort of traits of his, that I picked which are sort of, you know larger bucketing of of some of his personality are: deep observation, scientific method and pattern matching. So, let's dive into a little bit of each of these and see
how they sort of manifest.

## Deep Observation 

So, deep observation is, so there's a very famous quote that Sherlock Holmes says in one of the books he says, he says, "You see but you do not observe" and that's a that's a that's a very interesting difference, distinction to call out. That if essentially, when we have data in front of us, our default is to look at it and absorb the information as is, but when we actually start observing it more closely, we gain more nuance by just interacting with that information as an active participant and that is a skill that I think is worth building on. 

## Be fully present and mindful 

So some of the ways that you can build on that skill is, to just be fully present and very mindful. So when you're mindfully interacting with not just the person who you know your stakeholder, your your business partner, like people like that, like when you're mindfully interacting with them, you're more engaged, you are not going to be distracted and that will mean that don't you don't miss out on something that's critical for you to, you know be able to solve the problem at hand, and I think it's one of the best ways to have impact.

## Be an active participant 

The other way to improve your observation is to be an active participant in with whatever you're doing.  So you know one of the you know, one of the fun examples that they called
out, is that you know when Sherlock Holmes was given, you know he said they said oh here we found this note and this is a clue, so he didn't actually just read it, he didn't just like, you know look at it, he he actually smelt it too because he said you know smelling it is gonna give me some extra insight and I just reading it doesn't doesn't give me. And that is a very interesting thing, because you're you know you're actively participating with the information in front of you you're you're being inclusive, you're not just saying well this is how I normally look at data, but like you're trying to be you're trying to be thoughtful and getting into the weeds of how you can
use use information in in in to tell you different insights. 

## Structure your thinking

The next thing again,about improving your observation is to structure your thinking. So this one is, you know I think, like all good engineers have to do it, you have to just be
structured, you have to keep good documentation. I think for data scientists it's especially relevant, because you know sometimes during our analysis, we'll make some assumptions 
and if it's not or we'll make some decisions, rather and if it's not an intuitive decision like why did we make that decision, maybe we made it because we spoke to a colleague who pointed something out.  And if two months later, we'd forget why we why we decided to go this direction with our analysis, it will be really helpful to you if you have actually sort of documented that somewhere, so that even you yourself are not struggling with figuring out why you, why you did something specific. So you know and and like being structured also means that you you try to look at information and sift through it and say like you know let me step back and decide what is actually useful to me, what is just a red herring or something that's kind of taking me away from what I'm actually trying to do here. 

## Scientific Method (22:24)

The next character trait was scientific method. And here again, you know the famous quote here is: "When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth" It's a very, it's a very scientific way of thinking about it, cause we you know we have to regard facts as truth. Even if we can't see it and if the most likely answer is not the answer and the impossible answer is not the answer, we have to give the improbable answer a chance to prove itself. And we have to be truthful, saying that if this is where things are pointing me I have to give it a shot, to sort of see if that's actually true or not. 

## Avoid the trap of bias

So here again, you know you can build on this skill by just generally avoided avoiding the trap of bias. And I think you know, a lot of times it's it's very easy, like it's human nature, that we are the if we're given if you're given something that makes our life easier. So someone states an opinion which sounds kind of correct, like it makes our brain,
is programmed to just attach to it because it makes our life easier, so but we should we should you know purposefully step away from that because a lot of times opinions are stated as facts. And people then there must have been tons of companies that you know, said hey our monthly active users just never go down, like we're a growing company and then coronavirus hit and of course a lot of companies lost lost users and if they had treated that as a fact. That like there's just no way that we can ever have less people coming to
our site. You know they would have just found it way harder, to be like well you know why is this happening now? Of course in this example, I'm assuming people weren't living under a rock and they kind of heard about the COVID situation, so hopefully they would have been able to piece things together, but you know there could be some situations there you just don't know what's going on. And the other thing here is you know, we tend to, the information that is available to us, like the information that's in front of us that we can see we
tend to weigh that more heavily than what we don't have access to. So for example, if I have access to the sign-ups that occurred on my website, but I don't have access to the actual, you know volume of people who came to my site and bounced out without signing up. I will just look at my signups and be like yeah it's going really well, you know I'm I have so many people coming to my site but the fact is while that singularly might be true. If you just have had a lot more people come and yes overall your signups are going going
higher, but your rate of conversion is actually lowering your you're missing out on key information by like just being biased towards the information that's available to you at that point.

## Build hypothesis to be tested 

And then you know, the last way to build this skill, is to you know regular science facts like: build a hypothesis test it out, if you have multiple multiple options to go with you rank them pick the most likely one first to test out, and keep kind of validating each of them until you find something that fully explains what issues you might be having.  
## Pattern Matching  (25:55)

The last skill was about pattern matching, so you know, "There is nothing more deceptive that an obvious fact" as Sherlock Holmes said. And it's it's it's because you know the
interesting thing, was Holmes was actually considered to be very good at understanding human behavior and predicting human behavior, even though he was considered someone who wasn't
actually very good at empathizing. And I and that may seem you know not very aligned, but the sheer fact is that when you understand, when you understand situations, people all of that, better you are much more easily able to find patterns. And you know that hey this may present as an obvious fact, but it's very common for people to sort of you know stated as a fact, but it's not it's not true, so like let me dig into it a little bit more.

## Objectivity can help parse information

So a good way to improve on this skill, is just to be very objective when you're trying to parse information. You know understand the people that you're dealing with, understand their motivations, understand that fears, those things could be very different than yours. So if you have stakeholders, you know if you have a product person and a Marketing person, for both coming and telling you this data looks wrong, they might have very different opinions on where they think the problem occurs. And you have to still separate yourself from
you know from from sort of those two conflicting, conflicting directions and pick what what makes the most sense for you to investigate first. Because you because you know otherwise you won't be objective and you won't you won't stay focused on the truth. Say as you hear as you hear opinions and ideas, I guess always good to understand that, also for future reference but try to sort of like parse the right information from it. 

## Widen your knowledge base

The last way to sort of improve on that skill, is to just in general widen your knowledge base. So you know, as as a data scientist, I think it's extremely important that like obviously we have to get really good at understanding the data, appreciating what it does. But the other part is, like if you if you do an equally good job at also understanding
the product, understanding the users, understanding how your marketing channel works, and things like that, it can actually allow you to make a hypothesis much more easily, when you sees things that are going wrong. And you'd be in a better position because you would have seen some odd things that happen, which if you just focused on the data you
wouldn't have access to so it, it basically allows you to consider you know factors outside of just just what's in what's in front of you. 

## Let's walk through an example (28:44)

All right, so hopefully they're all made sense, so far. Now, we are actually going to walk through an example, so you know we hopefully we understand a little bit how Sherlock Holmes thinks and how we can apply his mindset to our own problem-solving techniques.  So now I'm going to walk through a simple example, where we will try to use some of those philosophies that I kind of just highlighted. And for the sake of simplicity, I am going to go with the assumption, that we eventually have one warehouse where we store all our data regardless of where it comes from so whether it's initially coming from, Salesforce heap, website logs, whatever. All of it comes and it sits in one data warehouses. I want to make life my life
easier and just compare two data sets in the same place. 

## It always starts with a question!

So this is, this is typically, how they how the question starts and I I hope a lot of you can relate to this specific example. Which is, you know, you have a colleague maybe they are in Marketing or something and they come to you with the question. They say, the number of sales in May I pulled one number from Salesforce report and today they reported something else in All Hands and you know what's the deal? Why they why they are not matching, so obviously a lot of things could have gone wrong. And for the purpose of this example, we are actually going to pretend everything that could go wrong, did indeed go wrong.  And yeah I'll add that you know of course, if you've been at a company for a while or if you've interacted with that same data set for a long time, you'd probably have you'd probably start building out a good idea of where the problem might be. But for this example, yeah for this example, I am going to assume that you just joined two hours ago, you know no one, you know nothing, all you know is your Snowflake warehouse password and what the offending data sets are. 

## Sanity checklist to examine the facts (30:45)

So before we begin actual coding, some simple sanity check lists to just examine the facts. We are talking about two different numbers. Basic questions are: they even supposed
to represent the same information? Sometimes numbers may be called the same thing, but they're actually not supposed to represent the same thing at all.  

So an example would be, that you know people may be just saying sign-ups but maybe the sign-ups that are stored on Salesforce on the Salesforce platform are referring to sign ups that need a Customer Success person to reach out. Whereas the sign-ups that would be stored in your internal table would be all sign-ups ever, so you know you're both calling it sign-ups, but is it actually all sign-ups and the same amount. The other thing to think about is, I think this is actually super super common, but you know are they from the
same time-frame and is your refresh data, refresh cadence for the two places that you're looking for information similar? And that is, I mean hands down one of the most common things that happens. That like one report could be set to begin at the first of the month, the other report is set for the first Monday of the month, or like you know they're set to different time zones.

Just just things like that, like they're all time-frame related things and those things you know again, get it out of the way quick because that is that is usually a very common reason for misalignment to occur. And the last thing here, are sanity checklist wise is just human error, you know. There's I mean I think all of us, no matter how foolproof we make
something, there's always gonna be some unintended use. There could be some typos, there could be some extra filters, there's just like basic things that are unintended, how you intention for them to be used. 

## Dataset and problem understanding

And then the last sort of checklist, before we get into the coding, is you know just understand, understand the data set and understand what the problem is, before you fully begin. So here again, the basic questions to ask you know what rules were each of the data sets built with, like is it just purely raw data and presented as is, or were there some transformations applied, were there some business rules applied on top of it. A lot of this information, is unfortunately tribal knowledge and you again as a good data scientist and as a good citizen you have to you have to actually start documenting some of these things. So that other detectives have an easier time and it's um it's totally worth the time. The other common thing, is the grain of the data set. So you could very often have something where again, they looked like they have the same number of columns, but maybe they're both aggregated at a completely different grain and that could also result in some unintended things that you can't see. And finally is there a pipeline issue? Again, that's also very
common, that like you know the pipeline just breaks for a couple of hours, or something like that and you're missing data from a specific like chunk of time, or or something weird is going on.  

## Now let's write some code... (34:07)

So now let's, sorry I just have some water, okay. So now let's actually, let's actually get into some code. So here's what a dataset looks like: it has an ID column and obviously there might be other columns as well, but these are the relevant ones we look at, there's an odd order date, there's a region, and there's a sales amount, and that's sort of the basic thing that we're dealing with.

## Volume and missing data check (34.37)

So the most obvious check to start with, when you're comparing two different data sets to see what's going on with them, you know are they the same or they not.
After answering all those sanity checks that we just did, the first thing is do they have the same number of rows, that can usually tell you a lot of what's going on. And so you know the simple thing there is just, `SELECT count(*)` from from both of them compare that number, of course you might decide to add like a WHERE clause if you're looking for a specific month, or a specific region, or whatever the difference is showing up, but this is your absolute bare minimum starting point. After that, if they if they don't actually have the same number of rows, first thing is let's look for missing information. So in this example, the ID was a unique column, so we're basically gonna look for, we're gonna find the missing ids. And we're gonna say, you know whichever one we're going to do a full FULL JOIN of the two tables and if the ID is null in one of the tables, that's the table that it's missing from. So this, you know the second query should essentially give you a list of all the missing IDs and which ID which table they're missing from.  And once you have that information, we will discuss few different ways you can go about it but that should give you some information. 

## Duplicate data check (36:00)

The next step, you know, I think even if you did find some missing information, I think it's still as long as like, I think it's still useful to look for duplicates anyways, because 
again pipelines do weird things and funky stuff can happen.  So here again, you're simply you know getting all the, all the all the IDS, you know grouping the IDs to get a count, and you're basically looking for any ID that has a count greater than one from each table, and you're unioning those two those two sub-queries and getting your final result that gives you the final answer. So this way again, you'll have one one result that will give you all the duplicate IDs that are that are missing, so that are that are duplicates and and
which table there are duplicate in.  So these these queries that we have so far, like of course there could be a lot of like extra clauses that you can build into it, but just kind of sharing it as examples of life starting points of how to start even thinking about some of these issues. 

## Dimension level data checks (37:07)

Next, and you know sort of the last SQL level check that I talked about is just doing a check at the dimension level.  So here is where it gets interesting and where your familiarity with the data can really help, but again in this example you're new to the companies you have no idea what's going on. Once you've sort of eliminated some of the basic things, you
want to start breaking things down by you know one dimension at a time, and seeing you know is there a case where things are consistently off across dimensions or it's only one dimension where there's something gone wrong. So like, for example, in this query I am looking essentially for regions, there the region the sales, the sum of the sales for a region in table, 1 is different from the sum of the sales in region two and in the same in table 2 for the same region. And this so that's why I'm only doing like, I'm only looking for, I'm only gonna it's only gonna result in the rows that have that have a difference and that is immediately gonna tell me, like if I see all the regions then the problem is either on a different dimension or there's something else going on. But if this data shows me that oh, only region that has a problem is say, the East region or something, then that immediately tells me that the rest of my pipeline is probably fine or my rest of my feature definition is fine. But at least I know to narrow down that I have to go do something about the East region, because that's where my problem is showing up. And like you like I said like if if the if all the regions are equally off, then you break it down by a  different dimension, maybe it's the product or something else, but the point is to keep doing those cuts until you find something where you have a step to dig further. 

## Dimension level data checks (39:10)

So this is, you know these are obviously, I mean these examples have this example has been simplified, to sort of give you a give you a taste of what what what this looks like, but you know I I expect that people will as they become more familiar with datasets they will build their own scripts and write their own queries to resolve common problems. And I think you know you should ideally make these things modular, so that you can convert those code snippets easily and share them, with the you know, share them save them, converted into reusable modules so that you can like change, change things and and kind of go around it, and you can also convert some of these things to visualizations to help you spot errors faster. So for example, like in my, you know in in in one of the places I used to work at, like I had these scripts like just kind of ready to go, cause I always knew where the pipeline would break and it was a different team that had to fix the pipeline, so I just had to provide them the proof that the pipeline was broken so I had these scripts is ready
to go. And when it wasn't a pipeline issue, when it was a feature definition issue, I would have like I would go through this because that was the most common thing and then I would have something else to go through cause I knew that okay for feature stuff I write different scripts or I have different filters or some or something like that. And yeah, you can you can kind of like build on these as you as you get more comfortable with the data.

## Prevention is better than cure (40:40)

So, to wrap it up. I think one of the things to keep in mind is that you know, as as we saw through a bit of the examples like prevention is a lot better than cure. And you know a lot of the sanity checks that we do, before we before we do anything, before we look into stuff like a lot of it comes into things that are easy to prevent if you do it in the beginning, so if you're as a company committed to reconciling on terminologies, documenting stuff, making sure everybody is data literate, it makes your life and everybody's life a whole lot easier. And I also think like automating stuff is extremely important, like you should not have to do anything manually, if you're if you're doing it more than once, then
by all means be absolutely lazy and just do it once then never do it again and automate it because I think I think that those that actually allows you to be be more efficient in what's going on. 

The other thing is just simplify your curated data sets, so anything that has way too much information that you don't use, is going to be very hard to debug, when a problem occurs because you just have so many different things to look at. So keep it extremely simple, keep it aggregated, to a level that you expect it to work at. And that way also specially 
like like at my company we use Snowflake, which is which is super fast, but like you know some of the old data warehouses it takes a while to run some queries. So it makes sense if you have something that's you know simple and aggregated, so that you only go up one level if you if you pinpointed the problem to like one one section. And yeah, I think again, like it's very important to have an actual governance standard and you know some sort of a philosophy about who owns what, who owns which part getting broken, who's in charge of reporting things, things like that. I think are extremely are extremely required and you should also have an audit process, so at some point you should do some kind of a quality or you know a data cleanup hackathon, that that is that is able to sort of address some of these some of these issues. 

## Keep breaking down problem into smaller parts (42:57)

So yeah, I guess you know overall like I think sort of wrapping up the philosophy and the methodology like you know, keep keep breaking down the problem into smaller parts until you are able to fully isolate where differences are occurring, and bad bad data is creeping up and you know the the the truth is out there somewhere, like you just you just have to sort of like keep finding a way to get to it.

## References (42:36)

And yeah, with that I, I just wanted to leave you all with some additional research and reference material. I think there are some great thoughts, that people shared about like bad data and also how to think like Sherlock Holmes, which you can apply for other things as well. And I also linked my own talk about thoughtful analytics, in case anybody is
interested, it is also on my website.

And yeah, that's that's that's that's it for today. Thanks so much for attending. A special thank you for Reshama and Data Umbrella for hosting me. This is, this is extremely fun. I haven't actually done a technical webinar, ever, so this has all been in-person so this kind of fun for me. I hope you found the content useful. 

## Questions (44:09)

I will be taking some questions now. But also keep in mind that Data Umbrella is going to publish a recording of this on their website, as well as on their YouTube channel. And I'll be doing the same as well in about a month's time, so you know feel free to stay in touch with me on Twitter and also if you have any questions I can answer them too, right now.
Yeah, you can hear me right? Yeah, great, yeah if anybody has any questions if you just want to post it on chat. Um, we have about ten minutes left in the hour so we could answer any questions. Any questions or any observations, anything else that you've noticed that helps you. We have Renee Phillips here, who is like she's like very very involved in Postgres
women, SQL and in the conference organizing, the conference as well. And um yeah. Awesome. Do you Shailvi, do you want to put in the chat the link to the careers page for Komodo Health? Yeah, let me let me quickly grab that. Great. There you go. Thank you. 

What's the hardest data quality problem I have faced? Um that's to be very very frank it's so I go with the hardest one first. Honestly it's convincing people that it's important, which which should not be a thing, but you know I think I think some organizations have very good data hygiene and they know sort of all the downstream issues that it can cause if
you don't notice these things up front. But I did work in an organization once, where it was just, it was, you know there was just absolutely like, there was a wild wild west of, like everybody just kind of do whatever, and you'll figure it out later and it caught it cause it was, so costly because it took so many people so much time, to try to like you know
reset some of the things that were just very very bad and yeah, that was that was pretty hard. The most fun one? I would say is yeah, I you know I I just, I like I like investigating stuff, like I I like having an analysis that I trust, so if there's something that comes up which you know which I'm confused like. Oh my why'd you know, why does this seem odd? Sometimes that entire investigation, is because I think there's bad data and maybe at the end of it I prove that it's not, like this is legitimately what our what our data is telling us, that's I think that's still a good outcome for me, because I think that whole process makes me understand the data a lot better, makes me trust different parts of it a
lot better, so I I do find it fun to have these challenges, every once in a while because, I think it allows me to engage with things more.

Ruchika aks, how do you take care of bias in the data when historically there has been a lot. So that's an interesting, that's an interesting question, I guess my first question to that would be, like how do you know there is there is bias or is it just that you're trying to make sure that there is there is no bias. So Ruchika I don't know if you had a specific sort of thing in mind, but I guess I'll just give you, I guess I'll just give you a general, making sure that there's no bias. Okay, yeah, I guess I guess for me, I am always trying to look at the use case. Ithink you know, whatever I'm trying to do, whatever I'm trying to get to as an answer, like I think, honestly for me it really comes down to talking to a lot of people and kind of almost poking holes at a problem.  Like what are the what are the ways this could go wrong, well you know we're we're doing something unintended, I actually, in one of the companies I used to actually sit go and sit with the customer support teams occasionally and like get them to tell me like you know just show me examples
of what people are complaining about, about our software. And you know that actually started an initiative, where we would we would flag things which seem like people just didn't trust something that was happening, like they didn't, they didn't think it made sense, and some of those things were, I mean there was like it was just there, was no reason for them to not trust it, but other things like it made sense and we did actually do some investigations where they're like, yeah the reason why this person said this looks suspicious
makes sense, because there is there is something odd happening there and that doesn't make sense.

Milena, what tools you use to clean up the data? So, I think that for me depends on what what I'm actually using, so I typically access most of my data in a SQL warehouse and I end up doing a lot of it there. If I have exported it out, then I usually use R, but again that's just my preference. My my entire team is very much on the Python bandwagon and that's that's what they use. Yeah. What additional functionality and unique capabilities does Snowflake provide? Oh I have to tell you, I'm very biased towards Snowflake, I am a huge
huge Snowflake fan girl. When I was joining Komodo Health actually, one of the first question I ask them is do you have Snowflake and they said yes and so I joined. Because my previous company did not have Snowflake and I was very annoyed by that, for the two and a half years that I work there. Snowflake is just really fast, it's it's it's such a it's, I mean yeah, I I'm like, I said I am amazingly, I like to spend less time doing stuff, so I was on Hadoop for awhile and those things used to take me like 20 minutes to run a query and then in Snowflake that same query would take a less than a minute. say I I I'm not paid by them. but I do like their tool quite a bit. 

I have a question for you. I was thinking when you're working with that many millions of records, do you often find those cases that are you know just a handful that are problematic and heavy? It's is it like finding a needle in a haystack or is it something that really, just sort of breaks all your programs because it's that exception? Yeah, that's a that's a
great question so, you know some of the, so some of the most like often that I did these investigations that actually at Salesforce. Where the platform that I worked on had 340 million users, so it was obviously yeah it was it was just a ton of data that was generated for for the stuff that we were using and that was the time I did not have Snowflake, so my queries would actually take longer. And then like that's the thing that I got to, like I think like we had a little bit of an understanding of like I think when I was at least able to explain, like here's why this data is always gonna be slightly shifted from this other data. Then people have less of a problem like if they if I if I've done that proof once, where it's like you know we expect there to be a 1% difference when you're pulling it from this source versus this source because you know they're they're out of sync they're
never gonna be in sync, there's always gonna be a little bit of lag here or something like that. Like then people have then, if people understand it they're okay with it, but if that shift ever like really changes like suddenly even from 1% it goes to 1.5 like if it's crossed a threshold that we have established as unknown then it warrants investigation. Like what's what's going on, like is this something that's breaking or is this really my data changing and I think in that like again, the more time I spent with that data the
more sort of checks I built in. One thing I forgot to mention, but like some of these queries that I had pulled, put out I actually, you know got some of the data engineers to convert them into alerts, so that if some of those checks didn't pass it would actually like things that I knew were to be true. Like I would have them coded into the things so that
before that data was even published, it would go through all of those checks and if something failed it would not publish that dataset. So, that then I could go and look at it and be like, does this look fine or does this not, does this require extra investigation and I think that was really helpful because then you're not on a totally wild goose chase.
You're actually, you know you're saying like, sure, here's what went wrong and here is what I am going to do out it. That's great. 

In Pharma, we used to call those edit checks. Yeah. I don't know if they call them the same thing.  Yeah, yeah. Awesome. Cause we have another couple of minutes, does anybody else have any questions?

Awesome. So thank you so much for joining us, um from San Fran from San Francisco right, your that's where you are? Yes. I'm in New York and the recording will be available soon. I'll send a message to the meetup group, it's on our Data Umbrella events page. And Renee is asking if you would like to do a webinar for Postgres women New York City? Yes, absolutely, thank you. All right, um thank you everybody and watch our meetup page for upcoming events. Have a good night. Awesome, thank you so much, bye.
