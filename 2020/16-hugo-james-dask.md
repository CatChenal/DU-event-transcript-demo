okay
hello and welcome to data umbrella's
webinar for
um october
so i'm just going to go over the agenda
i'm going to do a brief introduction
then there will be the workshop by hugo
and james and you can ask questions
along the way
in the chat or actually the best place
to ask questions is the q
a and there's an option to upvote as
well
um so yet um asking the q a if you
happen to post it on the chat by mistake
i can
also transfer it over to q a so that
would be fine too
and this webinar is being recorded
uh briefly about me i am a statistician
and data scientist and i am the founder
of data umbrella um
i am on a lot of platforms as rachmas so
feel free to follow me on twitter and
linkedin we have a code of conduct
we're dedicated to providing harassment
free experience for everyone
um thank you for helping to make this a
welcoming friendly professional
community for all
and this code of conduct applies to the
chat
as well
so our mission is to provide an
inclusive community for underrepresented
persons in data science and we are an
all volunteer run organization
you can support data umbrella by doing
the following things you can follow our
code of conduct and
keep our community a place where
everybody wants to keep coming to
you can donate to our open collective
and that helps to pay meet-up dues and
other operational costs
and you can check out this link here on
github
we have this new initiative where all
the videos are being transcribed and so
is to make them more accessible so we
take the youtube videos and we put the
raw there and so we've had a number of
volunteers help us transcribe it
so feel free to check out this link
and maybe if you do this video
maybe the two speakers will follow you
on twitter i can't promise anything but
it's possible
um dave umbrella has a job board and
it's at jobs.org and once this gets
started i'll put some links in the chat
the job that we are highlighting today
is is the machine learning engineer job
by
development seed and development seat is
based in washington dc and lisbon
portugal
and they do i'm going to go to the next
slide
what they do is they're doing social
good work and so they're doing
for instance mapping elections from
afghanistan to the u.s analyzing public
health and economic data from palestine
to illinois
and leading the strategy and development
behind data world bank
and some other organizations and i will
share a link to their job posting in the
chat as well
as soon as i finish this brief
introduction
check out our website for resources
there's a lot of resources on learning
python um and r also for contributing to
open source
also for guides on accessibility and
responsibility
and allyship
we have a monthly newsletter that goes
out towards the end of the month and it
has information
on our upcoming events we have two great
events coming up in
november and december on open source so
subscribe to our newsletter um to be in
the know
we are on all social media platforms as
data umbrella
um meetup is the best place to join to
find out about upcoming events
our website has resources follow us on
twitter
we also share a lot of information on
linkedin
and if you want to subscribe to our
youtube channel we record all of our
talks and post them there
um within about a week of the talk so
it's a good way to get information
okay and now we are ready to get started
so
i will hand it over to um put myself on
mute and i will hand it over to
hugo and james and let you take over but
thank you all for joining i just want to
thank reishima um
christina and and everyone else who tied
all the tireless effort that that goes
into putting
um these meet-ups and these online
sessions together
i i think um one thing i want to say is
actually the
the last in-person workshop i gave
either at the end of february or early
march
um was data umbrellas in inaugural
tutorial and meetup if i if i recall
correctly on on bayesian bayesian
thinking and um hacker statistics and
simulation and that type of stuff
so it's it's just wonderful to be back
particularly with um
my colleague and friend friend james
we're building really cool um
distributed
uh data science products um at coiled
we'll say a bit about that
um but we'll do some introductions in in
a bit i just wanted to
um get you all accustomed to it was
february thank you reishma
um uh we're working um with uh jupiter
notebooks
in a github repository the repository is
pinned uh to the top of the chat this is
um
what it looks like these are all the
files this is the file system
now we use something called binder
which is a project um
out of and related to project project
jupiter which provides infrastructure
to run um notebooks without any local
installs so there are two ways
you can you can code along on this
tutorial the first is and i won't get
you to do this
yet um is to launch binder the reason i
won't get you to do that yet is because
once you launch it we have 10 minutes to
start coding or the binder session times
out i've been burnt
by that before um actually several times
i'm surprised i even remembered it this
time the other thing you can do
is install everything locally by cloning
the repository downloading anaconda
creating
a condor environment um if you haven't
done that um
i suggest you do not do that now and you
launch launch the binder um
james is going to start by telling us a
few
a few things about about gas and
distributed compute in general
my question for you james is if we get
people to launch this now
will we get to execute a cell
code cell in 10 minutes um i would let's
hold off for now maybe
yep maybe i'll indicate when we should
uh launch binder okay
fantastic cool um and just what i'm
looking at right now
is the github repository on your browser
okay
exactly so i will not launch binder now
i will not get you to now
i've i'm doing this locally um and we
see that i'm in uh notebook zero and if
you want to actually have a look at this
notebook before launching binder
it's in the notebooks data umbrella uh
subdirectory and its notebook zero and
we're going to hopefully make it through
the overview then chatting about dusk
dusk delayed
um and and data framing and machine
learning
um great so we have uh hashim has said
you could open in vs code as well
you could i mean that would require all
your local installs and that that type
of stuff
as well um but uh we're to introduce
uh me and james um we we work at coiled
um
where we uh build products for
distributed compute in infrastructure as
we'll see one of the big problems with
like bursting to the cloud is all the
like
kubernetes aws docker stuff so we build
a one-click host of deployments for das
but for data science and machine
learning
in general um james maintains task um
along with matt matt rocklin um who
created dusk uh
with a team people who was working with
continuum anaconda at the time
um and uh james is a software engineer
at
called and i run data science evangelism
marketing work on a bunch of product
product stuff as well um
wear a bunch of different different hats
occasionally
um there are many ways to think about uh
distributed compute and how to do it in
in python
we're going to present um hey james
you're muted
i'm taking it i went away based on what
i see in the chat you did you did but
now we're back i've introduced you
i've introduced me i've mentioned that
there are many ways to do distributed
compute
um in the python ecosystem and we'll be
chatting about one
called dask um and maybe i'll pass you
in a second but i'll say one thing that
i really like about
my background isn't in distributed
compute my background's in
pythonic data science um when thinking
about bursting to larger data sets and
larger models
there are a variety of options the thing
that took me
attracted me to desk uh originally
i saw cameron's note the ghost in the
machine aren't playing nice tonight i
think that ain't that the truth
um is that dark plays so nicely
with the entire pi data ecosystem so as
we'll see
if you want to write dash code for data
frames dash data frames it really mimics
your pandas code um same with numpy same
with scikit-learn
okay and the other thing is dark
essentially
runs the python code under the hood so
your mental model of what's happening
is actually corresponds to the code um
being
um being executed okay um
now i'd like to pass over to james but
it looks like he's disappeared
again i'm still here if you can hear me
i've just turned my camera off
oh yeah okay great i'm gonna turn my
camera hopefully that will help
yeah and i might do do the same for
bandwidth bandwidth issues so
if if you want to jump in and and
talk about dark at a high level um i'm
sharing my screen and we can scroll
through
yeah that sounds great so um that's sort
of
uh a nutshell you can think of it as
being composed of
two main uh uh well components
the first we call collections these are
the
user interfaces that you use to actually
construct a computation you would like
to compute in parallel or on distributed
hardware
there are a few different interfaces
that desk implements uh for instance
there's dask array
for doing nd array computations there's
das data frame for working with tabular
data
you can think of those as like gask
array as a parallel version of numpy
das data frame has a parallel version of
pandas and so on
there are also a couple other interfaces
that uh we'll be talking about das
delayed for instance we'll talk about
that today we'll also talk about the
futures api
those are sort of for lower level uh
custom algorithms
in sort of paralyzing existing uh
existing code
the main takeaway is that there are
several sort of familiar apis that desk
implements and that will use today
to actually construct your computation
so that's the first
part of desk it is these dash
collections you then take these
collections
uh uh set up your steps for your
computation
and then pass them off to uh the second
component which are
desk schedulers and these will actually
go through and
execute your computation potentially in
parallel
there are two flavors of schedulers that
desk offers the first
is a are called single machine
schedulers
and these just take advantage of your
local hardware they will
spin up a a local thread or process pool
and start submitting tasks in your
computation to to be executed in
parallel
either on multiple threads or multiple
processes there's also a distributed
scheduler
or maybe a better term for would
actually be called the advanced
scheduler because it works well on a
single machine
but it also scales out to uh multiple
machines so for instance as you'll see
later we will actually
spin up a uh distributed scheduler that
has workers on uh remote
machines on aws so you can actually
scale out beyond your
local resources like say what's on your
laptop
um kind of scrolling down then to the
image of the
uh cluster we can see the main
components of
the distributed scheduler and james i
might get people to spin up the binder
now
because we're going to execute codes now
is a good point yep
so just here's a quick break point
before you know a teaser for
um schedulers and what's happening there
i'll ask you
to um in the repository there's also the
link to the binder
click on launch binder i'm going to open
it in a new tab and
what this will create is an environment
in which you can just execute the code
in in the notebooks okay
so hopefully by the time we've gotten
gone through this section
this will be ready to start executing
code so if everyone wants to do that to
code along otherwise just
watch or if you're running things
locally also cool thanks james
yeah yeah no problem thank you so so
yeah looking at the image
for the distributed scheduler we're not
gonna have time to go into
the um a lot of detail about the
distributed scheduler in this workshop
so but we do want to provide at least a
high level overview of the
the different parts and components of
the distributed scheduler
um so the first part i want to talk
about is in the diagram what's labeled
as a client
so this is the user facing entry point
to a cluster
so um wherever you are running your
python session
that could be in a jupiter lab session
like we are here
that could be in a python script
somewhere you will create
and instantiate a client object that
connects
to the second component which is the das
scheduler
so each desk cluster has
a single scheduler in it that sort of uh
keeps track of all of the state for all
of the
the state of your cluster and all the
tasks you'd like to compute so from your
client you might start submitting tasks
to the cluster the schedule will receive
those tasks
and compute things like all the
dependencies needed for that task like
say you're uh implementing you say you
want to compute
task c but that actually requires first
you have to compute task b
and task a like there are some
dependency structures there
it'll compute those dependencies as well
as keep track of them
it'll also uh communicate with all the
workers to understand
what worker is working on which task and
as
space frees up on the workers it will
start farming out uh
new tasks to compute to the workers um
so
in this particular diagram there are
three das distributed workers here
um however you can have as you can have
thousands of workers if you'd like
so the workers are the things that
actually compute the tasks
they also store the results of your
tasks and then serve them back to you
and the client
the scheduler basically manages all the
state needed to
perform the computations um and you
submit tasks
from the client so that's sort of a
quick
whirlwind tour of the different
components for the distributed scheduler
um and at this point i think it'd be
great to actually see
see some of this in action um hugo would
like to take over
absolutely thank you for that wonderful
introduction to darsk and
and the schedulers in particular and we
are going to see that um with dark in
action
uh i'll just note that this tab in which
i launched the binder is up and running
if you're going to execute code here
click on notebooks
click on data umbrella oop
and then go to the overview notebook
and you can drag around we'll see the
utility of these these dashboards
in a second but you can you know drag
your stuff around to
to make you know however you want to
want to structure it and then you can
execute code
in here i'm not going to do that i'm
going to do this
locally at the moment but just to see
dust in action
to begin with i'm going to i'm actually
going to
restart kernel and clear my outputs
um so i'm going to import uh from dash
distributed the client
the sorry the other thing i wanted to
mention is um we made a decision around
content for this
we do have a notebook that we we love to
teach on schedulers but we decided to
switch it out for machine learning for
this workshop in particular we are
teaching a similar although distinct
workshop um at pi data global
so we may see some of you there in which
we'll be going um more in depth
into schedulers as well um so if you
want to check that out
definitely do so we instantiate the
client
which as james mentioned is kind of what
we work with as the user um to submit
our code
um so that will take take a few seconds
um okay it's got a port in you so it's
going going elsewhere
what i'll just um first get you to
notice is that it
tells us where our dashboard is um and
we'll see those tools in a second
tells us about our cluster that we have
four workers eight cores
um between eight and nine gigs of of ram
okay um now this is something i really
love about dusk all the diagnostic um
tools if i click on the little desk
thing here
and we've um modified the binder so that
that exists there as well
um we can see i'll hit search and it
should that now corresponds to
the the scheduler now i want to look at
the task
stream which will tell us in real time
what's happening i also want to look at
the
cluster map so we see um here this is
already really cool
um we've got uh all of our workers
around here and our scheduler
scheduler there and when we start um
doing some compute we'll actually see
information flowing between these um and
the other thing
maybe i'll yeah i'll
include a little progress um
and that can be an alternate tab to um
ask um i'm wondering
perhaps i also want to include something
about the workers
yeah okay great so we've got a bunch of
stuff
that's that's pretty interesting there
and so
the next thing i'm going to do we've got
a little utility file which um downloads
some of the data
and this is what it does is if you're in
binder it downloads a subset of the data
if you're anywhere else it loads a
larger set
um for this particular example we're
dealing with a small data set
you see the utility of dark and
distributed compute when it generalizes
to larger data sets
but for pedagogical purposes um we're
going to sit with a smaller data set so
that we can actually run
run the code there's a trade-off there
um so
actually that was already downloaded it
seems but you should
all see it download i'm actually going
to run that in the binder
just to you should start seeing
downloading nyc flights data set
done extracting creating json data etc
okay now what we're going to do
is we're going to read in this data as a
dask data frame and
what i want you to notice is that it
really the das code mimics pandas code
so instead of pd read csv we've got dd
read csv
um we've got you know this is the file
path um
the first argument we're doing some
parse date setting some data types
okay um we've got a little um
wild card regular expression there to to
join uh
to do a bunch of them um and then we're
performing a group by
okay so we're grouping by the origin of
these flight flight data
we're looking at the the mean departure
delay group by origin
the the one difference i want to make
clear is that
in das we need a compute method
um that's because das performs lazy
computation it won't actually
do anything because you don't want it to
do anything on really large data sets
until you explicitly tell it tell it to
compute so i'm going to execute this now
and we should see some information
transfer between the scheduler and the
workers and we should see tasks
starting starting to be done okay
so moment of truth
fantastic so we call this a pew pew plot
because we see pew pew pew
um we saw a bunch of data transfer
happening between them these are all our
cause
and we can see tasks happening um it
tells us what tasks there are we can see
that most of the time was spent
uh reading reading csvs then we have
some um
group bias on chunks and and that type
of stuff
um so that's a really nice uh diagnostic
tool to see what most of your work
um is is actually doing uh under dark
work as you can see memory used cpu use
um uh
more fine-grained examples there um so
i i'd love to know if um
in the q a um
i'm going to ask were you able to
execute this code and if you were in
binder just a thumb up
a vote would be no would be fantastic
um much appreciated um
so as we've mentioned i just wanted to
say a few things about tutorial goals
um the goal is to cover the basics of
dark and distributed compute we'd love
for you to walk away with an
understanding of when to use it when to
not what it has to offer we're going to
be covering um the basics of dusk
delayed
which although not immediately um
applicable to data science
provides a wonderful framework um
for thinking um about dusk how dark
works and understanding how it works
under the hood
then we're going to go into dark data
frames and then machine learning
hopefully um due to the technical um
considerations with um we've got less
time than
than we thought we would but um we'll
definitely do the best we can
we may have less time to do uh exercises
so we've had two people who are able to
execute this code
if you if you tried to execute it in
binder and were not able to
perhaps post that in the q a um
but um we also have several exercises
um and i'd like you to take a minute
just to do this exercise
the i i'm not asking you to do this
because i want to know if you're able to
print hello world i'm essentially asking
you to do it
um so you get a sense of how these
exercises work so
if you can take 30 seconds to print
hello world
um then uh we'll we'll move on after
that so just take um
30 seconds now
and it seems like we have a few more
people who are able to execute code
which which was great
okay fantastic so you will put your
solution there for some reason i have um
an extra cell here so i'm just going to
clip that
and to see a solution uh i'll just get
you to execute
this cell and it provides the solution
and then we can execute it and compare
it to the
the output of what you had okay hello
world um
so as as we saw i've done all this
locally you may have done it on binder
um
there is an option to work directly from
the cloud um and i'll i'll take you
through this there are many ways to do
this
as i mentioned we're working on one way
with coil and i'll explain the rationale
behind that
in in a second but i'll show you how
easy it is
to get a cluster up and running on on
aws without even interacting with
aws for free for example you can follow
along by uh signing into uh coiled cloud
to be clear this is not a necessity and
it does involve you signing up to our
product so i just wanted to be
absolutely transparent
about that it does not involve any
credit card information or anything
along those lines and in my opinion it
does give a really nice
uh example of how to run stuff on the
cloud um
to do so you can sign in at cloud dot
coiled
uh dot io you can also pip install
coiled and then
do authentication you can also spin up
this
this hosted coiled notebook so i'm
going to spin that up now and i'm going
to post that
here um actually yep i'm gonna post that
in the ch
chat um if you let me get this right
um if you've if you've never logged in
to code before it'll ask you to sign up
using gmail or github so feel free to do
that if you'd like
if not that's also also cool um but i
just wanted to be explicit
uh about that um the reason i want to do
this
is to show how dars can be leveraged to
do work on
really large data sets so you will
recall that i had between eight and nine
gigs of ram on my local system
um oh wow anthony says on ipad unable to
execute on binder
incredible um i don't have a strong
sense of how binder works on ipad
i do know that i was able to um
to check to use a binder on my iphone
several years ago on my way to scipy
doing code review for someone for eric
maher i think for what that
that's worth um but back to this
um we have this nyc taxi data set which
is over 10 gigs it won't even
i can't even store that in local memory
i don't have enough ram to store that
so we do need um either to do it
locally in an out of core mode of some
sort or we can we can burst to the cloud
and we're actually going to burst to the
cloud
using using coiled um so the notebook
is running here um for me and but i'm
actually gonna do it uh from my local
local notebook
but you'll see and once again feel free
to code along here
it's spinning up a notebook and james
who is
is my co-instructor here um is to be i'm
i'm so grateful
all the work is done on our notebooks in
coiled you can
launch the cluster here and then analyze
the entire um over 10 gigs of data there
i'm going to do it um
here so to do that i import coiled
and then i import the dash distributed
stuff and then
i can create my own software environment
cluster configuration i'm not going to
do that
because the standard coiled cluster
configuration software environment works
now i'm going to spin up a cluster and
instantiate a client
now because we're spinning up a cluster
uh in in the cloud
um it'll take it'll take a minute a
minute or two
enough time to make a cup of coffee but
it's also enough time for me to just
talk a bit about why this is important
um and there are a lot of a lot of good
good people working on
on similar things um but part of the
motivation here is that
if you want to you don't always want to
do distributed data science okay um
first i'd ask you to look at instead of
using dark if you can optimize your
pandas code
right um second i'd ask if you've got
big data sets
it's a good question do you actually
need all the data so
i would if you're doing machine learning
plot your learning curve see how
accurate see how your accuracy um
or whatever your metric of interest is
improves as you increase
the amount of data right um and if it
plateaus before you get to a large data
size then
you may as well most of the time use
your small data um
see if sub sampling um can actually give
you the results you need
um so you can get a bigger bigger access
to a bigger machine
so you don't have to burst to the cloud
but after
all these things if you do need to boast
burst to the cloud
until recently you've had to get an aws
account
um you've had to you know set up
containers with docker and or
kubernetes um and do all of these kind
of
i suppose devopsy software engineering
foo
stuff um which which if you're into that
i
i absolutely encourage you encourage you
to do that
but a lot of working data scientists
aren't paid to do that um
and um i don't necessarily want to
um so that's something we're working on
is thinking about these kind of
one-click hosted deployments so you
don't have to do
all of that um having said that um i
very much encourage you to try doing
that stuff if
if you're interested um we'll see that
the
the um cluster has just been created
um and what i'm going to do we see that
um oh i'm sorry
i've done something funny here i'm
i'm referencing the previous client anna
james
yeah it looks like you should go ahead
and connect a new client to the coil
cluster and making sure not to
re-execute the cluster
creation exactly so
would that be how would i
what's the call here i would just open
up a new
cell and say client equals
um capital client and then pass in the
cluster
like open parentheses cluster yeah
great
okay fantastic and what we're seeing is
a slight version this
we don't need to worry about this this
is essentially saying that um
the environment on the cloud mis is
there's a slight mismatch with my
with my local environment we're fine
with that i'm going to
um look here for a certain reason
um the the dashboard isn't quite working
here at the moment james would you
suggest i just click on this and open a
new
yeah click on the ecs uh dashboard link
oh yes fantastic
so um yep there's some
bug with the local dashboards that we're
we're currently
currently working on but what we'll see
now
just a sec i'm going to remove all of
this
we'll see now that i have access to 10
workers i have access to 40 cores
and i have access to uh over 170 gigs
of memory okay so now i'm actually going
to
import this data set and it's the entire
um year of data from 2019
and we'll start seeing on on the
diagnostics all the all the processing
happening okay so oh
actually not yet because we haven't um
called compute okay so it's done this
lazily um
we've imported it um it shows kind of
like pandas when you
show a data frame um the column names
and data types
um but it doesn't show the data because
we haven't loaded it
yet it does tell you how many partitions
it is so essentially and we'll see this
soon
das data frames correspond to
collections of pandas data frames
um so they're really 127 pandas data
frames underlying this task data frame
so now i'm going to do the compute well
i'm going to
set myself up for the computation um to
do a group by passenger gown and look at
the main tip
now that took a very small amount of
time we see the ipython magic
timing there because we haven't computed
it now we're actually going to compute
um and james if you'll see in the chat
eliana said her coil
coiled authentication failed i don't
know if you're able to
to help with that but if you are that
would be great
um and it may be difficult to debug in
but look as we see we have the task
stream now
um and we see how many you know we've
got 40 cores
working together we saw the processing
we saw the bytes stored
it's over 10 gigs as i said um and we
see we were able
to do our um
basic analytics um
we were able to do it on a 10 plus gig
data set in in 21.3 seconds
which is pretty pretty exceptional um
if any any code based issues come up
and they're correlated in particular so
if you have questions about the
code execution please ask in the q a um
not in the chat because others cannot
vote it and i will definitively
prioritize
questions on technical stuff
particularly ones that up that are
upvoted
um but yeah i totally agree thanks
thanks very much
um so yeah let's jump into
into um data frames
so of course we write here that in the
last exercise um we used ask delayed to
parallelize uh loading multiple csv
files into a pandas data frame
um we're not we we haven't done that but
you can definitely go through and have a
look at that
um but i think perhaps even
more immediately relevant for a data
science crowd and an analytics crowd is
which is what i see here from the
reasons people people have joined um is
jumping into dusk data frames
um and as i said before adas data frame
um
really feels like a pandas data frame um
but internally it's composed of many
different
different data frames this is one one
way to think about it that we have all
these pandas data frames
um and the collection of them is a dark
data frame
and as we saw before they're partitioned
we saw
when we loaded the taxi data set in the
dash data frame was 127 partitions right
um where each partition was a normal
panda pandas data frame
um and they can live on disk as they did
early uh in the first example dark in
action or they can live on other
machines as when i spun up
a coiled cluster and and did it on on
aws
um something i love about darth's data
frames i mean i ran about this
all the time um it's how it's the pandas
api and and matt
matt rocklin actually um uh
has a post on on the
blog called a brief history of dusk in
which he talks about the technical goals
of
us but also talks about a social goal of
task which in matt's words is to invent
nothing he wanted and the team wanted
um the dusk api to be as
comfortable um and familiar for users
as possible and that's something i
really appreciate
about it so um we see we have element
element uh wires on operations we have
the
our favorite row eyes selections we have
loc we have the common aggregations we
saw group buyers before we have
is-ins we have date time string
accessors
um oh james we forgot to i forgot to
edit this and i
it should be grouped by i don't know
what what a fruit buy is but that's
something um
we'll make sure the next iteration to to
get right at least we've got it right
there and in the code
um but have a look at the dash data
frame api docs to check out what's
happening
um and a lot of the time dash data
frames can serve as drop in replacements
for pandas data frames
the one thing that i just want to make
clear as i did before
um is that you need to call compute
because of the
lazy laser compute property of das
so this is wonderful to talk about when
to use
data frames so if your data fits in
memory
use pandas um if your data fits in
memory and your code
doesn't run super quickly um
i wouldn't go to dusk i'd try to i'd do
my best to optimize my pandas code
before trying to get gains gains and
efficiency um
but dark itself becomes useful when the
data set you want to analyze is larger
than your machine's ram
um where you normally run into memory
errors and that's what we saw
with the taxicab example the other
example that we'll see when we get to um
[Music]
machine learning is
you can do machine learning on a small
data set that fits in memory but if
you're
building big models or training over
like a lot of different hyper parameters
or different types of models
you can you can parallelize that using
using dark so there is
you know you want to use dash perhaps in
the big data or medium to big data limit
um as we see here um or in the medium to
big model limit where training
for example takes and takes a lot of
time okay
so without further ado uh let's get
started with das data frames
um you likely ran this uh preparation
file to get the data in the previous
um notebook but if you didn't execute
that um
now we're going to get our file names by
doing
doing a few joins and we see our file is
a string data nyc
flights um a wildcard
to access all of them dot dot csv
and we're going to import our dusk
dust.dataframe and read in our dataframe
um parsing some dates setting some
sending some data types
okay i'll execute that we'll see we have
10
partitions um as we noted before
if this was a pandas data frame we'd see
a bunch of entries here
we don't we see only the column names
and the data types of the columns um and
the reason is
as we've said it explicitly here is the
representation of the data frame object
contains no data
um it's done dusk has done enough work
to read the start of the file
um so that we know a bit about it some
of the important stuff and then further
column types and
column names and data types okay but we
don't once again we don't let's say
we've got 100 gigs of data
we don't want to like do this call and
suddenly it's reading all that stuff in
and
doing a whole bunch of compute until we
explicitly
uh tell it to okay now this is really
cool if you know a bit of pandas
you'll know that you can um there's an
attribute columns which
prints out it's well it's actually the
columns form an index right the pandas
index
object um and we get the we get the
column names there
cool pandas in dark form
we can check out the data types as well
um as we would in pandas we see we've
got some ins for the day of the week
we've got some floats for departure time
um maybe we'd actually um prefer that to
be
you know a date time at some point we've
got some objects which generally are the
most general on
objects so generally strings um
so that's all pandasey type stuff in
addition das data frames have
an attribute um n partitions which tells
us the number of partitions and we saw
before
that that's 10 so i'd expect to see 10
here hey look at that
um now this is something that
um we talk about a lot in the
delayed notebook is really the task
graph
and i don't want to say too much about
that but really it's a
visual schematic of of the order in
which different types of compute happen
okay um and so the task graph for
read csv tells us what happens when we
call compute
and essentially it reads csv um
10 ten times zero indexed of course
because python
um it reads csv uh ten different times
into these ten different pandas pandas
data frames
and if there were group buys or stuff
after that we'd see them happen in
in the in the graph there and we may see
an example of this in a second
um so once again as with pandas
um we're going to view the the head of
the data frame
great and we see a bunch of stuff um
you know we we see the first first five
rows um
i'm actually also gonna gonna have a
look at the
the tail the final five rows that may
take longer um
because it's accessing the the final i
um
i there's a joke and it may not even be
a joke how much
um data analytics is actually biased by
people looking at the first five rows
before actually
you know interrogating the data uh more
more seriously um so how would all of
our results look different
if um if our files were ordered in
in a different way that's another
conversation for a more philosophical
conversation for another time
um so now i want to show you some
computations
with uh dark data frames okay so
since dash data frames implement a
pandas like api
um we can just write our familiar pandas
codes so
i want to look at the column um
uh departure delay and look at the
maximum of that column
i'm going to call that max delay so you
can see we're selecting the column
and then applying the max method as we
would with pandas oh what happened there
gives us some uh da scala
series um and
what's happened is we haven't called
compute right so it hasn't actually done
the compute yet um
we're going to do compute but first
we're going to visualize the task graph
like we did
here and let's try to reason what the
task graph would look like right so
the task graph first it's going to read
in
all of these things and then
it'll probably perform this selector
on each of these
different pandas data frames comprising
the dash data frame
and then it will compute the max of each
of those and then do a max on all those
maxes
i think that's what i would assume is
happening here
great so that's what we're what we're
doing we're reading this so we read the
first
um perform the first read csv get this
das data frame
um get item i think is that selection
then we're taking the max
we're doing the same for all of them
then we take all of these max's
and aggregate them and then take the max
of that okay so that
that's essentially what's happening when
i call compute which i'm going to do
now
moment of truth okay
so uh that took around eight seconds and
it tells us the max
and i i'm sorry let's let's just get
out some of our dashboards up
as well um
huh i think in this notebook we are
using the single machine scheduler hugo
so i don't think there is a dashboard to
be seen exactly
yeah thank you for that that that catch
james um
great um is even better
um uh james we have a question around
using dark for
um reinforcement learning can you
can you speak to that um yeah so
uh it depends on this i mean yeah short
answer
yes you can use gas to train
reinforcement learning models
um so there's a package that hugo will
talk about called desk ml that we'll see
in the next notebook uh for distributing
machine learning
um that paralyzes and and distributes
um some existing models uh using desks
so for instance things like
random forces forest inside kit learn
um so so yes you can use das to uh
uh do distributed training for models
i'm not actually sure if gaskml
implements
any reinforcement learning models in
particular
um but that is certainly something that
that can be done
yeah and i'll i'll build on that by
saying we are about to jump into machine
learning
um i don't think as james said i don't
think
there's reinforcement learning um
explicitly that
that one can do um but um you of course
can use the das
scheduler yourself to um you know to
distribute any reinforcement learning
stuff
you you have as well and that's actually
another another point to make that maybe
james can speak to a bit more is that um
the dark team of course built all of
these high-level collections and task
arrays and
dust data frames and were pleasantly
surprised when
you know maybe even up to half the
people using dust came in all like we
love all that but we're going to use
the scheduler for our own bespoke use
cases right
yeah exactly yeah the original intention
was to like make basically a num
like a parallel numpy so that was like
the desk array stuff like run
run numpy and parallel on your laptop um
and and yeah so in order to do that we
ended up
building a distributed scheduler um
which sort of does
arbitrary task uh computations so
not just things like uh you know
parallel numpy but
really whatever you'd like to throw at
it and uh it turns out that ended up
being really
useful for people um and so yeah now
people use that
um sort of on their own uh just using
the distributed scheduler to do
totally custom algorithms um in parallel
um
in addition to these like nice
collections like you saw hugo presents
the dash data frame um api is you know
the same as the panda's api so there is
this like familiar space you can use
things
like the high-level collections but you
can also run
uh whatever custom like hugo said
bespoke computations
you might have exactly and it's it's
been wonderful to see
so many people so many people do that
and the first thing
as we'll see here the first thing to
think about is if
if you're doing lifestyle compute if
there's anything you can you know
parallelize embarrassingly as they say
right so just
if you're doing a hyper parameter search
you just
run some on one worker and some on
the other and there there's no
interaction effect so you don't need to
worry about that as opposed to
if you're trying to do um
you know train on streaming data where
you may require it all
to happen on on on the same worker okay
um yeah so even think about trying to
compute the standard deviation of a
of a a univariate data set right um
in in that case um you can't just send
you can't just compute the standard
deviation on two workers and then
combine the result in some some way you
need to do something slightly slightly
more nuanced and slightly
slightly clever more clever um i mean
you still can actually in
in that case but you can't just do it as
naively as that
um but so now we're talking about
parallel and distributed machine
learning we have 20 minutes left so this
is kind of going to be a whirlwind tour
but um you know whirlwinds when safe uh
exciting and informative um i just want
to make clear the material in this
notebook is based on the open source
content from darsk's
tutorial repository as there's a bunch
of stuff we've shown you today
the reason we've done that is because
they did it so well so i just want to
give a shout out to all the das
contributors
okay so what we're going to do now is um
just break down machine learning scaling
problems into two categories
just review a bit of psychic learn in
passing um
solve a machine learning problem with
single michelle single michelle
um i don't know who she is but single
michelle wow
single machine and parallelism with
psychic learning job lib
then solve an l problem with an ml
problem with multiple machines and
parallelism using uh dark as well
and we won't have time to burst for the
cloud i don't think but you can also
play
play around with that okay so as i
mentioned before
when thinking about distributed compute
a lot of people do it when they have
large data they don't necessarily think
about the large model limit
um and this schematic kind of speaks to
that um
if you've got a small model that fits in
ram you don't need to think about
distributed compute
if your data size if your data is larger
than your ram
um so your computer's ram bound then you
want to start going to a distributed
setting or if your model is big and cpu
bound um such as like large-scale
hyper-parameter searches or like
ensembl blended models of like machine
learning algorithms
um whatever it is and then of course we
have the
you know big data big model uh limit
where um distributed computer desk is
incredibly handy as i'm sure
you could uh imagine okay and
that's really what i've what i've gone
through here
um a bird's-eye view of the strategies
we think about um
if it's in memory in the bottom left
quadrant just use scikit-learn or your
favorite ml library
um otherwise known as psychic learn um
for me anyway
um
i was going to make a note about xg
boost but i but i won't
um for large models
uh you can use joblib and your favorite
circuit learn estimator
for large data sets uh use our dark ml
estimators so we're gonna do a whirlwind
tour of psychic learn in
in five minutes we're going to load in
some data so we'll actually generate it
we'll import scikit-learn for our ml
algorithm create an estimator
and then check the accuracy of the model
okay so once again i'm actually going to
clear all outputs after restarting the
kernel
okay so this is a utility function of
psychic learn to create some data sets
so i'm going to make um
a classification data set with four
features and 10 000 samples and just
have a quick view
um of some of it um
so just a reminder on ml
um x is the samples matrix um the size
of x
is um the number of samples
uh in terms of rows number of features
as columns
um and then a feature or an attribute
is uh what we're trying to predict
essentially okay um so why um
is the predictor variable uh which we're
where
um which we're or the target variable
which we're trying to predict so let's
have a quick view
of why it's zeros and ones in in this
case
okay so um yep that's what i've said
here
why are the targets which are real
numbers for regression tasks or integers
for classification
or any other discrete sets of values um
no words about unsupervised learning at
the moment we're just going to support
we're going to
fit a support vector classifier for this
example
so let's just load the appropriate
scikit-learn
module we don't really need to discuss
what
support vector classifiers are at the
moment now this is one of the
very beautiful things about the
scikit-learn api
in terms of fitting the the model
we instantiate um a classifier and we
want to fit it
to the features with respect to the
target okay so the first argument is the
features second argument
is the target variable
so we've done that now i'm not going to
worry about inspecting the learn
features um i just want to see how
accurate it was okay and once we see how
accurate it was i'm not gonna do this
but then we can um make a prediction
right
using uh estimator dot predict on a new
a new data set
um so this estimator will tell us
so this score will tell us the accuracy
and essentially
that's the proportion or percentage
a fraction of um
the uh results that were that the
estimator got correct and we're doing
this on the training
data set we've just trained the model on
this so this is telling us
um the accuracy on the on the training
data set okay so it's 90
accurate on the training data set if you
dive into this a bit more you'll
recognize that
um if we we really want to know the
accuracy
on a holdout set or a test set
um and it should be probably a bit lower
because this is what we use to fit it
okay
but all that having been said i expect
um you know
if if this is all resonating with you it
means we can really move on to the
distributed stuff um um in in a second
um but the other thing that that's
important to note is that we've trained
it but
a lot of model a lot of estimators and
models have um hyper parameters that
affect the fit but you
that we need to specify up front um
instead of being learned during training
so
you know there's a c parameter here
there's a uh
are we using shrinking or not um so we
specify those
we didn't need to specify them because
there are default values but here we
specify them
okay and um
then we're going to um
look at the score now
okay this is amazing we've got 50
accuracy um
which is the worst score possible just
think about this if if you've got binary
classification task and you've got 40
accuracy then you just flip the labels
and that changes to 60 accuracy so it's
amazing that we've actually hit
50 accuracy we're to be congratulated on
that
um and what i want to note here is that
we have two sets of hyper parameters
we've used one's
created 90 actual model with 90 accuracy
another one one with 50 accuracy um
so we want to find the best hyper
parameters essentially and that's why
hyper parameter optimization
is is so important um there are several
ways to do hyper parameter optimization
one is called grid search uh cross
validation i won't talk about cross
validation
um it's essentially um a more robust
analogue of train test split where you
uh train on a subset of your data and
compute the accuracy on a test
on a holdout set or a test set um cross
validation is
a as i said a slightly more robust
analog of this
it's called grid search because we have
a grid of hyper parameters so
we have you know in this case we have a
hyper parameter c we have a hyper
parameter kernel
and we can imagine them in a in a grid
and we're performing
um we're checking out um the score
over all this gr over this entire grid
of hyper parameters okay
so to do that um i import grid search
csv
now i'm going to um
compute um the estimator over
over these train the estimator over over
this grid um
and as you see this is taking time now
okay
um and what i wanted to make clear and i
think should be becoming
clearer now is that if we have a large
hyper parameter
uh sweep we want to do on a small data
set das can be useful for that
okay because we can send some of the
parameters to
one worker some to another and they can
perform them um in parallel so that's
embarrassingly parallel because
you're you're doing the same work as you
would otherwise
um but sending it to a bunch of
different workers we saw that took 30
seconds which is in my realm of
comfort as a data scientist i'm happy to
wait 30 seconds
um if i had to wait much longer if this
grid was bigger
i'd start to get probably a bit
frustrated um
but we see that it computed um
it for c is equal to all combinations of
these
essentially okay um so that's really all
i wanted to say there um and then we can
see the best parameters
and the best score so the best score was
0.098 and it was c10 and the kernel um
rbf a radial basis function it doesn't
even matter what that is though
um for the purposes of this so we've got
10 minutes left we're going to
we're going to make it i can feel it i
have a good i have a good sense
um a good after the
i mean this demo is actually going
incredibly well given um the initial
technical hurdles so touchwood hugo um
okay so what we've done is we've really
segmented ml scaling problems into
two categories cpu bound and ram bound
um and i
i really i can't emphasize that enough
because i see so many people
like jumping in to use new cool
technologies um without
perhaps taking it being a bit mindful
and
intentional about it and reasoning about
when things are useful and and when not
um
i suppose the one point there is that
sure data science is a technical
discipline but there are a lot of other
aspects to it
um involving this type of reasoning
as well so we then carried out a typical
sklearn workflow for ml problems
um with small models and small data and
we reviewed hyper parameters and hyper
parameter
optimization um so in this section
um we'll see how job lib which is a set
of tools to provide lightweight
pipelining
um in python uh gives us parallelism on
our laptop and then we'll see how dark
ml can give us um awesome parallelism
uh on on clusters okay so essentially
um what i'm doing here is i'm doing
exactly the same as above
with a grid search but i'm using the
quark the keyword argument n
jobs which tells you how many tasks uh
to run in parallel
using the cause available on your local
workstation and specifying minus one
jobs
means the it just runs them the maximum
possible
okay so i'm going to execute that
great
so we should be done in a second feel
free to ask um any questions
in the chat oh alex
um has a great question in the q a does
das have
uh see a sequel and query optimizer
um i'm actually so excited that um
[Music]
and james maybe you can provide a couple
of links to this um
we're really excited to have seen dark
dust sql um
developments there uh recently um
so that's dark hyphen hyphen sql um
and we're actually we're working on some
some content and a blog post and maybe a
live live coding session
about that in in the near future um so
if anyone if you want updates from from
coyle feel free to go to our website and
sign up for our mailing list
and we'll let you know about all of this
type of stuff but the short answer is
yes alex and it's getting better and um
if james is able to post post a link
there that would be that would be
fantastic
um so we've done link in the chat
fantastic um
[Music]
and so we've we've seen how
we have um
[Music]
single machine parallelism here um using
the
um using the end jobs quark um and in
the final minutes
let's see multiple multi-machine
parallelism
with dusk okay um so
what i'm going to do is i'm going to
uh do my imports and create my
client incentive my client and check it
out
okay so once again i'm working locally
um i hit search and that'll
task is pretty smart in terms of like
knowing uh which which client i want to
check out
do the tasks stream
because it's my favorite i'll do the
cluster map otherwise known as the pew
pew map
um and then
i want some progress we all we all crave
progress don't we um
and
maybe my workers tab okay great so um
we've got that up and running now i'm
going to do a slightly uh
larger hyper parameter search okay um
so remember we had just a couple for c
a couple for kernel um we're going to do
more we have some for shrinking now i'm
actually
going to comment that out because i
don't know how long that's going to take
um if you're coding them on binder now
this may actually take
far far too long for you um but we'll
we'll see so i'll execute this code and
we should see
just sick no we shouldn't see any work
happening yet um
but what i'm doing here is
oh looks like okay my clusters back up
great
we're doing our grid search but we're
going to use um
dask as as the back end right and this
is a context manager where we're
asserting that um
and and we can just discuss the the
syntax there but it's not particularly
important currently i'm going to execute
this now
and
let's see
fantastic we'll see all this um data
transfer happening here we'll see our
tasks
um happening here we can see these big
batches of fit and score
fit um so fitting fitting the models
then finding um
how well they perform uh via this
k-fold cross validation
which is really cool
and
let's just yep we can see um
what's happening here we can see we
currently have 12 processing we've got
seven in memory and we have um
several more that we need to do uh our
desk workers we can see
us oh we can see our cpu usage
we can see how we can see cpu usage
across all the workers which is which is
pretty cool seeing that distribution
is uh is really nice whenever some form
of b swarm
plot if you have enough um would would
be useful there
or even um some form of cumulative
distribution function or something like
that
um not a histogram people okay um you
can go to my bayesian tutorial
um that i've taught here before to hear
me rave about um
the the horrors of histograms um
so we saw that talk a minute which is
great and we split it across
you know eight cores or whatever it is
and now we'll have a look
once again we get the same best
performer which is which is a sanity
check
um and that's pretty cool
i think um we have a we actually have a
few minutes left so i am gonna
just see if i can um
oh let me think
yeah i will see if i can burst burst to
the cloud and and
and do this um that will take uh a
minute
a minute or two to create the cluster
again um but while we're while we're
doing that i'm wondering if we have any
any questions um or if
anyone has any feedback on on this
workshop i very much welcome
welcome that um perhaps if there are any
final messages you'd
you'd like to say james while we're
spinning this up you can
you can let me know yeah sure i just
also first off wanted to say thanks
everyone for attending and like bearing
bearing with us uh with the technical
difficulties really appreciate that
um real quick i'm just yeah so if you
have if you have questions please post
in the q a section while the cold
cluster's spinning up uh
theodore posted in the last largest
example of grid search
how much performance gain did we get
from using das and not just in jobs
hmm that's a great question and we
actually
didn't see um let's see
so it took 80 seconds
ah let me get this they're actually not
comparable
um because i did the grid search over
a different set of hyper parameters i
did it over a larger set of hyper
parameters
um right so when i did um
end jobs i did it there were only um it
was a two by two grid of hyper
parameters
whereas when i did it um with with dusk
it was a
one two three four five six six by three
so let's just reason about that um this
one was
eighteen six by three is eighteen which
took eighty seconds
um and this one was two by two
uh so it was four and it took
26 seconds um
so a minor gain i think with this hyper
parameter
search if you multiply that by by four
you'll
well 4.2 4.5 you'll need that would have
taken maybe two minutes or something
something like that so we saw some
increase in efficiency
not a great deal but um james maybe you
can say more to this
part of the reason for that is that
we're doing it on kind of a very small
example so we won't necessarily see the
gains in efficiency
with a data set this size and with um a
small hyper parameter suite like this is
that right
yeah yeah and um yeah exactly and i
guess also this is more of an uh kind of
an illustrative point here
i guess uh so you're just using uh
directly using in jobs with
something like job lib um by default
we'll use local threads and processes
on like whatever machine you happen to
be running on so
like in this case on hugo's laptop um
one of the real advantages of using
uh job lib with the das back in will
actually dispatch
back to um to run tasks on a dash
cluster is that your cluster can
expand beyond what local resources you
have
so you can run um you know you can
basically scale out like for instance
using the coil cluster
uh to have many many cpus and
a large amount of ram that you wouldn't
have on your locally uh table to run and
there you'll see
both large performance gains as well as
you'll be able to expand
your the set of possible problems you
can solve uh
to larger than ram uh scenarios so
you're out of out of core training
exactly and thank you jack this was
absolutely unplanned and we didn't plan
that question but that's a wonderful
segue into
me now performing exactly the same
compute with the same code
using uh the dasc as the parallel back
end um on a
on a coiled cluster which is an aws
cluster right
um so we can i'm more currently anyway
so i will execute
this code um and it's exactly the same
as we did
um whoa
okay great um so
we see our tasks task stream here
um
you see once again we see the majority
is being batch
um uh fit and and getting the scores out
um
similarly we see the same result being
the best
i'll just notice that for this for this
small task doing it on the cloud took 20
seconds
uh doing it locally for me took um 80
seconds so that's a four-fold increase
in performance
on a very small task so imagine what
that does if you can
take the same code as you've written
here and burst to the cloud
uh with with one click or however
however you do it um
i think that that's incredibly powerful
and that the fact that your code
and what's happening in the back end
with dusk um generalizes immediately to
the new setting of working on a cluster
i personally find very exciting and if
you work with larger data sets or
building larger models or big hyper
parameter sweeps i'm pretty sure
um it's an exciting option for all of
you also um
so on that note um i'd like to reiterate
james what james said and thanking you
all so much
for joining us um for asking great
questions
and for bearing with us through some
some technical technical hurdles
but it made it even even funner when
when we got up and running uh once again
i'd love to thank
mark christina and and the rest of the
organizers for doing such a wonderful
job
um and doing such a great service to uh
the data science and machine learning
community and ecosystem worldwide so
thank you once again for having us
thank you hugo and james um i have to
say like with all the technical
difficulties i was actually giggling
because it was kind of funny um
yeah but we're very sorry and we thank
you for your patience
and sticking through it and um
i will um be editing this video
to um you know make it as efficient as
possible
and have that available tim supercard
thank you um great and i'll just ask you
if you are interested in checking out
coiled go to our website if you want to
check out our product
go to cloud.coil.io we started building
this company in february
um we're really excited about building a
new product um so if you're interested
reach out we'd love to chat with you
about what we're doing and what we're up
to
um and it's wonderful to be in the same
community as you all so thanks
