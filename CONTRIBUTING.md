### Submitting Edits

### Transcribing
- For beginning of sentences, make them capital letters
  - Example:  when "i" as in "i think", can you change to capital letter:  "I think ..."  
- Break sections down into paragraphs (not one whole file)
- For the sections, add some timestamps, so people know where they can find it in the video?  Breaking it down every 10 minutes or so is acceptable. (That would be 6 timestamps for a 1-hour talk.)   
  - Example of sub-section and timestamps
```text
### Set Up Repository (3:46)
```
- Add period to the end of sentences.  
- Fix spelling
  - Example:  PY Ladies  ===>  PyLadies
  - Example: "data umbrella" ===> Data Umbrella
  - Example: "reishmas" ===> Reshama
- When I did this, I listened to the video for a couple of sentences, and then stopped it.  Then I edit the text and then I start the video again for another sentence or two. 

### Notes
- It can take a good 2 to 4 hours to edit a transcript for a 1-hour video.  
- It is not necessary to include screenshots of slides.
